#tr.en: the decisions of the land

#tr.en: may that stela

#tr.en: only to the fool, 
#tr.en: are they meaningless, 
#tr.en: but to the wise 
#tr.en: they are praiseworthy. 
#tr.en: If that man (a future ruler) 
#tr.en: my pronouncements

#tr.en: heeds, and 
#tr.en: my judgments does not reject, 
#tr.en: my pronouncements

#tr.en: not heed 
#tr.en: and should he my curses 
#tr.en: slight, and 
#tr.en: the curses of the gods 
#tr.en: not fear and 
#tr.en: thus the judgments that I judged 
#tr.en: overturn 
#tr.en: my pronouncements 
#tr.en: change 
#tr.en: my engraved image 
#tr.en: alter 
#tr.en: my inscribed name

#tr.en: do so— 
#tr.en: that man, 
#tr.en: whether a king, 
#tr.en: a lord, 
#tr.en: a governor, 
#tr.en: or a human 
#tr.en: called by any name, 
#tr.en: may the great Anu,

#tr.en: the supplanting of his dynasty, 
#tr.en: and that his name and his memory 
#tr.en: from the land

#tr.en: with his venerable speech 
#tr.en: may he declare. 
#tr.en: May Ninlil, 
#tr.en: the great mother, 
#tr.en: whose utterance

#tr.en: take precedence, 
#tr.en: the sage among the gods, 
#tr.en: all-knowing, 
#tr.en: who lengthens 
#tr.en: the days of my life, 
#tr.en: of all understanding 
#tr.en: and wisdom 
#tr.en: deprive him, and 
#tr.en: and into confusion 
#tr.en: may he lead him; 
#tr.en: his rivers 
#tr.en: at the source 
#tr.en: may he dam up; 
#tr.en: in his land 
#tr.en: barley, 
#tr.en: life of the people, 
#tr.en: may he not allow. 
#tr.en: May Šamaš, the great judge 
#tr.en: of heaven

#tr.en: who provides just ways 
#tr.en: for all living creatures, 
#tr.en: the lord, my trust, 
#tr.en: his kingship overturn; 
#tr.en: his judgments 
#tr.en: may he not render;

#tr.en: and the morale of his army 
#tr.en: undermine; 
#tr.en: when divination is performed for him, 
#tr.en: an inauspicious omen 
#tr.en: of the uprooting 
#tr.en: of the foundations of his kingship 
#tr.en: and the obliteration of his land may he provide;
#tr.en: may the malevolent word 
#tr.en: of Šamaš swiftly 
#tr.en: overtake him, 
#tr.en: above 
#tr.en: from among the living 
#tr.en: may he uproot him 
#tr.en: and below

#tr.en: To Yasmaḫ-Addu

#tr.en: The inhabitant of Rapīqum 
#tr.en: that tablet let him send. 
#tr.en: To Addaya, 
#tr.en: speak;

#tr.en: your son: 
#tr.en: As to Mērānum the physician’s

#tr.en: he has not arrived, and 
#tr.en: Rīšiya

#tr.en: Numushda, rejoicing over Martu,
#tr.en: offered him silver, but he would not accept it.
#tr.en: He offered jewels, but he would not accept them.

#tr.en: “Because the head of Išme-Addu, enemy of my lord, I cut off, and 
#tr.en: to my lord sent, men of Ḫurraya 
#tr.en: and men of Šinaḫ came. They cut down my orchards.” 
#tr.en: and thus: “Come! Let me the city entrust to you, 
#tr.en: so that to my lord I may go out.” To Ibal-Addu 
#tr.en: I wrote, and 50 soldiers to guard Ašnakkum 
#tr.en: he sent in, then Šaddun-laba and Ibal-Addu 
#tr.en: to me in the assembly of Haneans 
#tr.en: at Siharata arrived. Thus: “Perhaps 
#tr.en: to my lord I will go out, and after my (departure) 
#tr.en: the cities that with me are hostile, against Ašnakkum, 
#tr.en: would not approach and the mouth of the city would not stir up?” 
#tr.en: Now together with the Haneans into the heart of the country 
#tr.en: with him I will go, and intelligence of the cities 
#tr.en: that with him are hostile I will get. Within three days, 
#tr.en: a complete report to my lord 
#tr.en: I will send. The steppe and the mār-Sim’al 
#tr.en: are well. 
#tr.en: To my lord speak! 
#tr.en: Thus Ibal-El 
#tr.en: your servant: 
#tr.en: The tablet of Ibal-Addu from Ašlakka 
#tr.en: arrived here; to Ašlakka 
#tr.en: I went, but to slaughter a donkey foal 
#tr.en: between the Haneans and Idamaraṣ 
#tr.en: a puppy and a goat they brought! 
#tr.en: My lord I revered, and a puppy 
#tr.en: and a goat I did not give; 
#tr.en: a donkey foal, the young of a donkey mare, 
#tr.en: I had slaughtered; 
#tr.en: peace between the Haneans 
#tr.en: and Idamaraṣ I established; 
#tr.en: in Hurraya, 
#tr.en: in all of Idamaraṣ, 
#tr.en: the Ḫanu people will be satisfied, a sated person 
#tr.en: no enemy has; 
#tr.en: may my lord rejoice!  This my tablet 
#tr.en: in Rataṣpātum 
#tr.en: to my lord I sent; 
#tr.en: after this my tablet, 
#tr.en: on the 3rd day, to my lord 
#tr.en: I will arrive. 
#tr.en: The steppe and the mār-Sim’al are well. 
#tr.en: To our father, Zimri-Lim, 
#tr.en: speak! 
#tr.en: Thus Kabiya 
#tr.en: and Yumraṣ-El, 
#tr.en: your sons: 
#tr.en: to 
#tr.en: our father we prepared to travel, but 
#tr.en: rain 
#tr.en: and snow 
#tr.en: held us back. 
#tr.en: From Nagar 
#tr.en: until Ṭabātum 
#tr.en: they held us back. 
#tr.en: Now, the day our tablet, 
#tr.en: this one, 
#tr.en: to 
#tr.en: our father  
#tr.en: we sent, 
#tr.en: in Qaṭṭunān  
#tr.en: we arrived. 
#tr.en: To my lord, 
#tr.en: speak! 
#tr.en: Thus Warad-ilišu, 
#tr.en: your servant: 
#tr.en: As for the troops of Yamḫadum 
#tr.en: that went to Babylon 
#tr.en: Hammurapi 
#tr.en: at hearing the report 
#tr.en: was very happy. 
#tr.en: Thus that one: “Excellent, 
#tr.en: my brother the troops to Babylon 
#tr.en: sent. 
#tr.en: And my hem 
#tr.en: with the man of Babylon 
#tr.en: my brother tied.” 
#tr.en: And thus that one too: 
#tr.en: “Until Pudduḫum 
#tr.en: I will hold you back.”
#tr.en: After this letter 
#tr.en: that to my lord I have sent, 
#tr.en: the 5th day, 
#tr.en: from Ḫalab 
#tr.en: I will direct. 
#tr.en: To my lord 
#tr.en: speak! 
#tr.en: Thus Asqudum, 
#tr.en: your servant: 
#tr.en: the omens about the well-being 
#tr.en: of the messengers 
#tr.en: I did, and they are not favorable. 
#tr.en: I will again do for them. 
#tr.en: When the omens 
#tr.en: have become favorable, 
#tr.en: I will dispatch them. 
#tr.en: Another thing: concerning the patrols 
#tr.en: of the district of Ikšud-appašu 
#tr.en: and Ḫabduma-Dagan, 
#tr.en: no patrols 
#tr.en: are installed. 
#tr.en: And the stunted parts, whatever 
#tr.en: in the offerings of my lord 
#tr.en: are always showing up, 
#tr.en: my lord too knows. 
#tr.en: And the omens of the extispicies 
#tr.en: of the well-being of their districts 
#tr.en: To my lord 
#tr.en: speak! 
#tr.en: Thus Asqudum 
#tr.en: your servant: 
#tr.en: To the district of Ḫišamta 
#tr.en: and Terqa I arrived, and 
#tr.en: Numḫaya (and) Yamutbal 
#tr.en: together with boy and girl, 
#tr.en: male and female slaves, oxen and donkeys, 
#tr.en: “front and gate” they do not have. 
#tr.en: After they are done with the barley, 
#tr.en: the rush and reeds of the bank of the Euphrates 
#tr.en: their gobbling up I observed, and 
#tr.en: my tablet to my lord 
#tr.en: I sent. 
#tr.en: The feeding of animals, men and servants 
#tr.en: they cannot do; 
#tr.en: the grain of giving 
#tr.en: let my lord give; 
#tr.en: an order let him set. 
#tr.en: (Befitting) that of my servitude, 
#tr.en: to my lord I have written. 
#tr.en: My lord, (befitting) that of his kingship, 
#tr.en: let him reflect, and act! 
#tr.en: From Qaṭṭunan 
#tr.en: may they not cross over! 
#tr.en: Another thing: as for my arrival 
#tr.en: to the Terqaites 
#tr.en: I made a statement in the following way, thus I: 
#tr.en: “Fields add, so that 
#tr.en: the plows of the palace I may cause to be seized (for use).” 
#tr.en: And they answered me in following way, 
#tr.en: thus they: “Once our provenience fields 
#tr.en: we seize, the field of the palace inspect and take!” 
#tr.en: The circumstances I investigated, (and) the fields that they added, 
#tr.en: for 2 ploughs are not (even) sufficient. 
#tr.en: ... of my lord for Terqa is constant; 
#tr.en: 4 or 5 ploughs in the district of Terqa 
#tr.en: I caused to be seized (for use). But they are not suitable. 
#tr.en: Now when the r. of Terqa 
#tr.en: ... and the staff members did. 
#tr.en: ... my lord in ... 
#tr.en: ... 
#tr.en: ... 
#tr.en:  ... the servant  ...
#tr.en: their ... who seizes ... 
#tr.en: ... of that r., 
#tr.en: ... and I will give him as his gift. 
#tr.en: sesame let me cultivate. 
#tr.en: to the Terqaites let me give, and ... 
#tr.en: ... that are near (at hand), they will give ... 
#tr.en: To my lord speak! 
#tr.en: Thus Baḫdi-Addu, 
#tr.en: your servant: 
#tr.en: The Hanean rear contingent has arrived; 
#tr.en: The Hanean lead and rear contingents are well. 
#tr.en: No sickness, nothing, 
#tr.en: whatever losses are none, 
#tr.en: and the expeditionary force is well. 
#tr.en: May the heart of my lord not fear at all. 
#tr.en: Another thing: during all of the expeditions, 
#tr.en: I am all ears, and 
#tr.en: (there are) many worries. 
#tr.en: Now, in this expedition 
#tr.en: I am listening, and 
#tr.en: worries or anything, 
#tr.en: there is none; 
#tr.en: there is jesting and playing, 
#tr.en: like staying in their own households, 
#tr.en: their hearts are sweet; 
#tr.en: of the endeavor: doing 
#tr.en: weapons and killing the enemy, 
#tr.en: the heart of the servants of my lord is speaking. 
#tr.en: May my lord be happy! 
#tr.en: To my lord 
#tr.en: speak! 
#tr.en: Thus Meptum, your servant: 
#tr.en: (There are) 4 tablets 
#tr.en: of the governor of Susa in Elam, 
#tr.en: whom they killed—the carriers 
#tr.en: whom they in a campaign war captured— 
#tr.en: those tablets I opened, and 
#tr.en: thus I: “Perhaps 
#tr.en: a report of field and land 
#tr.en: in the tablets is recorded; 
#tr.en: if they did not open and hear, 
#tr.en: if to my lord I were not to send, 
#tr.en: and if I would not myself seize my report, 
#tr.en: (then it is as if) a report in them 
#tr.en: there was none.” Concerning the report 
#tr.en: of field and land, 
#tr.en: now these tablets to my lord 
#tr.en: I have sent. May my lord hear them. 
#tr.en: To Asqur-Addu, my lord, 
#tr.en: speak! 
#tr.en: Thus Meptum, your servant: 
#tr.en: Earlier this my tablet I sent to you, on the 4th day, 
#tr.en: ten thousand troops of Babylon, from Sippar 
#tr.en: crossed over. The leader of those troops 
#tr.en: (is) Mutu-adgim. Ḫulālum 
#tr.en: to Allaḫada for kingship 
#tr.en: in place of Atamrim they will lead. 
#tr.en: Now the report that I heard 
#tr.en: to you I have sent. 
#tr.en: Take action! 
#tr.en: And this report, that I sent to you, 
#tr.en: quickly to the king let it arrive! 
#tr.en: to ... for ... 
#tr.en: Since the confirmation ... 
#tr.en: sending I will send you. 
#tr.en: Now, the report that I heard 
#tr.en: I have sent you. 
#tr.en: Take action! 
#tr.en: A confirmation of this report 
#tr.en: they took from me, and 
#tr.en: to my lord quickly 
#tr.en: I am sending. 
#tr.en: To my lord 
#tr.en: speak! 
#tr.en: Thus Yasim-Sumû, 
#tr.en: your servant: 
#tr.en: Of the 42 men, 2 donkeys, 
#tr.en: sons of Ekallatum 
#tr.en: who arrived here, 
#tr.en: 1 female servant of ...-ḫu 
#tr.en: and 1 female servant of ... 
#tr.en: who in the palace 
#tr.en: they gave to them, 
#tr.en: I saw, and I held them back. 
#tr.en: And Awīl-Nanna in the following way spoke, 
#tr.en: thus (he): “If really 
#tr.en: the blinkers(?) that to the craftsmen 
#tr.en: you all gave, you held back, 
#tr.en: so there the same my lord will do. 
#tr.en: Now perhaps as to the two female servants 
#tr.en: that I held back, anger will arise. 
#tr.en: Either way, my lord should write to me. 
#tr.en: To my lord 
#tr.en: speak! 
#tr.en: Thus Iddin-Numušda, 
#tr.en: your servant: 
#tr.en: Previously 
#tr.en: my lord concerning the holding back 
#tr.en: of the expedition of Qaṭanum 
#tr.en: spoke to me, and 
#tr.en since five days 
#tr.en: the men I have held back; 
#tr.en: in extispicy 
#tr.en: have been used up. 
#tr.en: If it pleases my lord, 
#tr.en: my lord should write me, and
#tr.en: these men should not be held back! 
#tr.en: Let them go! 
#tr.en: The men are continuously distressed. 
#tr.en: On the 3rd day, 
#tr.en: a caravan will go out. 
#tr.en: With the caravan, 
#tr.en: the later one, 
#tr.en: may the messengers 
#tr.en: go out. 
#tr.en: To my lord 
#tr.en: speak! 
#tr.en: Thus Mukannišum, 
#tr.en: your servant: 
#tr.en: “Concerning the report of Addu, about which my lord gave me instructions, 
#tr.en: the report, about which my lord gave me instructions, 
#tr.en: for Inib-Šamaš 
#tr.en: and Ilšu-nāṣir, diviners, 
#tr.en: I dug out, and 4 lamb(-extispicie)s 
#tr.en: they performed, and their extispicies 
#tr.en: to my lord I had brought. 
#tr.en: A complete report 
#tr.en: may my lord send. 
#tr.en: Herewith, 6 bronze knives with silver plated, 
#tr.en: 3 large axes 
#tr.en: 1 ax of 1 1/2 mina, 
#tr.en: one large agasilikku (ax), 
#tr.en: ... piercers of 1 mina,

#tr.en: ... (linen) garments, 
#tr.en: ... bed: 
#tr.en: these utensils 
#tr.en: to my lord 
#tr.en: I have dispatched.” 
#tr.en: To my lord, 
#tr.en: speak! 
#tr.en: thus Kibrī-Dagan, 
#tr.en: your servant: 
#tr.en: Dagan and Yakrub-El are well. 
#tr.en: The city of Terqa and the district are well. 
#tr.en: Another thing: the day this tablet 
#tr.en: to my lord I sent. 
#tr.en: the ecstatic of Dagan 
#tr.en: came and 
#tr.en: a word in the following way spoke to me, 
#tr.en: thus: 
#tr.en: The god sent me. 
#tr.en: Come quickly! To the king 
#tr.en: write, and 
#tr.en: funerary offerings to the spirit 
#tr.en: of Yaḫdun-Lim 
#tr.en: they must dedicate. 
#tr.en: This that ecstatic 
#tr.en: said to me, and to my lord 
#tr.en: I have written. 
#tr.en: My lord what is pleasing to him 
#tr.en: must do. 
#tr.en: To my lord 
#tr.en: speak! 
#tr.en: Thus Kibrī-Dagan 
#tr.en: your servant: 
#tr.en: Dagan and Ikrub-Il are well. 
#tr.en: The city of Terqa and the district are well. 
#tr.en: In harvesting the grain of my district 
#tr.en: and piling up in the threshing floors 
#tr.en: I have not been negligent. 
#tr.en: Another thing: concerning the making of the new city gate, 
#tr.en: previously 
#tr.en: ..., the ecstatic, 
#tr.en: came to me, and 
#tr.en: he was in constant distress. 
#tr.en: Thus he: 
#tr.en: The work on that city gate 
#tr.en: begin! 
#tr.en: Now the day this, my tablet, 
#tr.en: to my lord I dispatched. 
#tr.en: That ecstatic returned here and 
#tr.en: in the following way spoke to me, 
#tr.en: and gave strong orders, thus: 
#tr.en: If this city gate 
#tr.en: you all do not construct, 
#tr.en: a ‘pile-up’ will occur. 
#tr.en: You all will not be successful! 
#tr.en: This, that ecstatic 
#tr.en: said to me. And in the harvest 
#tr.en: I am occupied. Diverting 
#tr.en: my servants I cannot do. 
#tr.en: If my lord commands, 
#tr.en: let help come here, and

#tr.en: To Yasmaḫ-Addu 
#tr.en: speak! 
#tr.en: Thus Išme-Dagan, your brother: 
#tr.en: Concerning the country Šušarrâ 
#tr.en: (about) which you wrote me, 
#tr.en: since this country is in confusion 
#tr.en: and we are unable to hold it back, 
#tr.en: let Išar-Lim speak to you; 
#tr.en: Lidaya, the Turukkean, 
#tr.en: and the Turukkean with him 
#tr.en: who in that country reside, 
#tr.en: became hostile, and two cities finished off.
#tr.en: I came to help, and 
#tr.en: to the heart of the mountains they entered. 
#tr.en: We reflected, and 
#tr.en: since that country 
#tr.en: for keeping back would not be led, 
#tr.en: that country 
#tr.en: I attacked, and 
#tr.en: from the country Arrapḫum 
#tr.en: and from the country Qabrâ 
#tr.en: up to... let colonize(?).
#tr.en: Troops of the heart of the country 
#tr.en: will be freed. 
#tr.en: I am well; your heart at all 
#tr.en: may not fear. 
#tr.en: To Yasmaḫ-Addu 
#tr.en: speak! 
#tr.en: Thus Išme-Dagan, your brother: 
#tr.en: Since with the troops to aid 
#tr.en: and support Samu-Addu 
#tr.en: to Karanaya I went, 
#tr.en: certainly earlier 
#tr.en: I wrote to you; 
#tr.en: the man of Ešnunna with the ensemble of his troops,
#tr.en: together with administrative staff 
#tr.en: and notables, 
#tr.en: gathered, and in Opis
#tr.en: sat, and 
#tr.en: further to the man of Babylon 
#tr.en: to meet up with him 
#tr.en: in Mankisi 
#tr.en: ... 
#tr.en: kept writing, but  
#tr.en: the man of Babylon 
#tr.en: did not agree, and 
#tr.en: although the man of Babylon did not agree, 
#tr.en: in his shamelessness he rose up against me, and 
#tr.en: to Maškulliya he went, and 
#tr.en: in Maškulliya 
#tr.en: to waterway dredging his hand set. 
#tr.en: The city Maškulliya 
#tr.en: above Dūr-ipiq-Addu 
#tr.en: at a distance of a double-hour set. 
#tr.en: As I Maškulliya approached, 
#tr.en: Samu-Addu wrote and with troops 
#tr.en: to the city I hastened, in the city arrived, and  
#tr.en: since matters were remarkable, the man of Ešnunna 
#tr.en: to do evil his face  
#tr.en: had set, to the heart of the land  
#tr.en: returned; Samu-Addu wrote me, and  
#tr.en: to the troops who with me came,  
#tr.en: report of dispatch,  
#tr.en: to Samu-Addu  
#tr.en: I sent; further, the remainder of the troops  
#tr.en: who in the heart of the land had dispersed;  
#tr.en: further, ...  
#tr.en: I ...,  
#tr.en: you need not be at all anxious. 
#tr.en: To Yasmaḫ-Addu 
#tr.en: speak! 
#tr.en: Thus Išme-Dagan, 
#tr.en: your brother: 
#tr.en: Concerning your messengers you wrote me. 
#tr.en: If this my tablet 
#tr.en: to you arrives, and 
#tr.en: it will be many days; from Madaraya 
#tr.en: go, a strong village 
#tr.en: is there. 
#tr.en: Go straight in, and 
#tr.en: house! 
#tr.en: Further, the next morning, early, 
#tr.en: to me come. 
#tr.en: Further, let your servant before you go along, 
#tr.en: let him be quick, so that to you 
#tr.en: at Tušḫum 
#tr.en: I can approach. If not thus 
#tr.en: you spent the night, but in Madaraya 
#tr.en: housed, as early as possible 
#tr.en: come, and your servant 
#tr.en: let go along, and just me 
#tr.en: let him notify. 
#tr.en: When the city 
#tr.en: I approach, 
#tr.en: and the gods 
#tr.en: like their messengers 
#tr.en: let them come. 
#tr.en: To Yasmaḫ-Addu 
#tr.en: speak! 
#tr.en: Thus Išme-Dagan, 
#tr.en: your brother: 
#tr.en: The extisipicies of the sacrifice 
#tr.en: you sent here, and I saw them; 
#tr.en: further, in the following way you wrote me, thus: 
#tr.en: The fat of the center 
#tr.en: to the right is black; 
#tr.en: The heart itself 
#tr.en: to the right and left is dark. 
#tr.en: Further, a thick scar is there. 
#tr.en: The dark spot of the left 
#tr.en: might not concern you. 
#tr.en: Now, these extispicies 
#tr.en: I have sent back to you. 
#tr.en: Read them! 
#tr.en: With the dark spots, 
#tr.en: the contradictory (patches), 
#tr.en: further a thick scar is there. 
#tr.en: There is nothing to be concerned about. 
#tr.en: To Yasmaḫ-Addu  
#tr.en: speak!  
#tr.en: Thus Aplaḫanda,  
#tr.en: your brother: Now good wine  
#tr.en: I have sent you; so drink! 
#tr.en: Now bread of Carchemish;   
#tr.en: so eat! Now 1 ... ; 
#tr.en: now 1 bracelet ... ;  
#tr.en: now 1 sūnu(-garment), further now  
#tr.en: 1 š(-garment) of dušûm(-stone color) 
#tr.en: I have sent you.  
#tr.en: Further, for the sake of all the terms  
#tr.en: to me keep sending!  
#tr.en: Further, as for me, to whom
#tr.en: will I look? 
#tr.en: This ..., the house of ...  
#tr.en: ... of Šamšī-Addu, my father, 
#tr.en: per your needs write me, and  
#tr.en: I have sent to you.  
#tr.en: and for ... something why  
#tr.en: do you not send to me?
#tr.en: Further, my father in ... 
#tr.en: is staying; ...   
#tr.en: One way or the other,  
#tr.en: write to me, and ...   
#tr.en: I will send to you. 
#tr.en: To Išme-Dagan 
#tr.en: speak! 
#tr.en: Thus Išḫi-Addu, your brother: 
#tr.en: This word is unspeakable, 
#tr.en: yet now may I speak, and 
#tr.en: further may my heart relax! 
#tr.en: A great king are you. Two horses 
#tr.en: as your request you requested from me, and 
#tr.en: But as for you, 20 minas of tin 
#tr.en: you sent to me. To not act 
#tr.en: straight with me 
#tr.en: may you not desire! This little tin 
#tr.en: you sent! If but 
#tr.en: you were not sending me anything! 
#tr.en: On account of the god of my father, 
#tr.en: if but my heart were ill! 
#tr.en: The price of horses, 
#tr.en: the aforementioned, 
#tr.en: with us in Qatna 
#tr.en: is 6 hundred (shekels) of silver, 
#tr.en: but you, 20 minas of tin 
#tr.en: you sent me. Further, the one who hears, 
#tr.en: will say what? “He has not dealt so with us.” 
#tr.en: This house is your house. 
#tr.en: In your house, what is missing? 
#tr.en: Does brother to brother 
#tr.en: a wish not grant? 
#tr.en: If but tin 
#tr.en: you were not sending to me! 
#tr.en: My heart 
#tr.en: would not have been sick at all. 
#tr.en: Not a great king are you. 
#tr.en: Why have you done this? 
#tr.en: This house is your house. 
#tr.en: To my lord Yasmaḫ-Addu 
#tr.en: speak! 
#tr.en: thus Asqudum, 
#tr.en: your servant: 
#tr.en: At my arrival 
#tr.en: in Terqa, 
#tr.en: Tarim-šakin 
#tr.en: arrived, and in the following way 
#tr.en: I asked him, thus I: 
#tr.en: “The extispicies to the well-being of the land, 
#tr.en: and the fortresses, 
#tr.en: did Zunan perform (them)?”

#tr.en: of the assinnum 
#tr.en: to my lord 
#tr.en: I have sent. 
#tr.en: To my lord 
#tr.en: speak! 
#tr.en: Thus Šibtu, 
#tr.en: your maid: 
#tr.en: In the Annunītum-house of the center of the city 
#tr.en: Aḫātum, daughter of Dagan-Mālik, 
#tr.en: went into a trance and in the following way spoke, 
#tr.en: thus: “Zimri-Lim, 
#tr.en: and if you disregard me, 
#tr.en: I myself over you 
#tr.en: am bursting (with love); 
#tr.en: your enemies 
#tr.en: in your hand 
#tr.en: I will fill; 
#tr.en: further, the men, my robbbers 
#tr.en: I will seize, and 
#tr.en: in the camp of Bēlet-ekallim 
#tr.en: I will collect them. 
#tr.en: The next day, 
#tr.en: Aḫum, the temple administrator, this report, 
#tr.en: a lock of hair 
#tr.en: and a hem 
#tr.en: brought to me, and to my lord 
#tr.en: I wrote. Lock of hair 
#tr.en: and hem 
#tr.en: I sealed, and 
#tr.en: to my lord 
#tr.en: I have sent. 
#tr.en: To my lord 
#tr.en: speak! 
#tr.en: Thus Šibtu, your maid: 
#tr.en: the temples, the palace, 
#tr.en: and the workhouses are well. 
#tr.en: Another thing: Kakka-Lidi 
#tr.en: in the temple of Itur-Mer saw (a vision); 
#tr.en: thus (her): “Two barge-rafts, 
#tr.en: large ones, the river were blocking, and 
#tr.en: the king and soldiers 
#tr.en: within were riding. Those on the right 
#tr.en: to the ones on the left 
#tr.en: were shouting, 
#tr.en: thus they: “Kingship, 
#tr.en: sceptre, throne, 
#tr.en: reign, land upper 
#tr.en: and lower 
#tr.en: to Zimri-Lim 
#tr.en: are given!”; further, the soldiers, 
#tr.en: all of them, were answering: 
#tr.en: “To Zimri-Lim 
#tr.en: it is given!” 
#tr.en: these barge-rafts 
#tr.en: to the gate of the palace 
#tr.en: ... 
#tr.en: ... ”  
#tr.en: To my lord 
#tr.en: speak! 
#tr.en: Thus Šibtu, 
#tr.en: your servant. The palace is well. 
#tr.en: The temples and workshops 
#tr.en: are well. 
#tr.en: At the beginning of the month 
#tr.en: extispicies for the wellbeing of my lord
#tr.en: I caused to have done, and 
#tr.en: the extispicy (reports) for the wellbeing of my lord
#tr.en: are propitious. 
#tr.en: From the heat,
#tr.en: my lord, his body 
#tr.en: may he guard. 
#tr.en: The ominous sign is established. 
#tr.en: According to the mouth of the gods
#tr.en: my lord, may he do.
#tr.en: And whoever among the kings
#tr.en: with my lord
#tr.en: straight speaks,
#tr.en: in the carrying 
#tr.en: with my lord, 
#tr.en: he will speak. 
#tr.en: To Sibtu 
#tr.en: speak! 
#tr.en: Thus your lord: 
#tr.en: As to what you in the following way wrote me, 
#tr.en: thus you: 
#tr.en: In the divination 
#tr.en: of weapons 
#tr.en: I am occupied.” In that which you wrote me, 
#tr.en: in the very divination of weapons, 
#tr.en: you are occupied? 
#tr.en: Why in the divination 
#tr.en: of the siezing of the city are you not occupied? 
#tr.en: Further, in the following way you did not write me,
#tr.en: thus you: 
#tr.en: “That city will be siezed,” 
#tr.en: or rather, “will not be siezed.” 
#tr.en: As to my quick arrival, 
#tr.en: about which you wrote me, 
#tr.en: quickly for the sacrifice of Ištar 
#tr.en: I will arrive. 
#tr.en: Say to my lord, 
#tr.en: thus Yaqim-Addu 
#tr.en: your servant: 
#tr.en: My lord wrote thus: 
#tr.en: 'Let the Babylonian army that is stationed 
#tr.en: at Sagaratum receive provisions in Sagaratum 
#tr.en: and have the one that is stationed at Dur-Yahdu-Lim 
#tr.en: receive provisions at Dur-Yahdu-Lim. 
#tr.en: Send that army and  
#tr.en: the army that you have registered.' 
#tr.en: The tablet of my lord arrived on the 5th day before nightfall. 
#tr.en: Before the tablet of my lord arrived, 
#tr.en: ... [the tablet?] of Nidnat-Sin... 
#tr.en: ... [the army?] of Babylon 
#tr.en: [...] my lord's tablet. 
#tr.en: ...because of fear of my lord 
#tr.en: I had it written. In my lord's registration tablet  
#tr.en: for the district which I sent back to him, 
#tr.en:  a 'himmum' is written. 
#tr.en: Now if it pleases my lord, 
#tr.en: let him consider if I should assign the old men 
#tr.en: and the young ones who cannot go on the campaign 
#tr.en: to guard the wall  
#tr.en: or the place my lord my lord orders,  
#tr.en: and choosing the elite army 
#tr.en: send them to my lord as per his instructions. 
#tr.en: Let my lord write to me whether this should be so. 
#tr.en: Perhaps my lord will say: 
#tr.en: 'The Babylonian army will be upset.' 
#tr.en: Like their compatriots, I have 
#tr.en: exempted them from service. 
#tr.en: That army has not been gathered. 
#tr.en: Following the day that they arrive 
#tr.en: in Sagaratum and the tablet of Nidnat-Sin 
#tr.en: comes to me, they will be released. 
#tr.en: To my lord 
#tr.en: speak! 
#tr.en: thus La’um, your servant: 
#tr.en: Asqudum, the diviner, 
#tr.en: from before the king 
#tr.en: came to me. 
#tr.en: Where he talked, many things he talked. 
#tr.en: To me they said so. 
#tr.en: Slander of me, 
#tr.en: slander of Sîn-Iddinam 
#tr.en: and of Šamaš-Illassu 
#tr.en: before the king he ‘ate.’ 
#tr.en: No one in his hand 
#tr.en: is safe. To my lord 
#tr.en: I will arrive, and 
#tr.en: a full report 
#tr.en: before my lord I will place. 
#tr.en: To Gerbil 
#tr.en: speak! 
#tr.en: Thus Bannum: 
#tr.en: “Your tablets you had sent here I heard. 
#tr.en: As follows you wrote me, 
#tr.en: thus you: 
#tr.en: ‘The extispicies for the well-being of the district 
#tr.en: I performed, and my extispicies were unfavorable; 
#tr.en: the foot(print) of an enemy was placed ..., 
#tr.en: and extispicies for Terqa, 
#tr.en: Saggaratum and Dūr-Yaḫdun-Lim 
#tr.en: for the days of a year or of 6 months 
#tr.en: have done.’ According to 
#tr.en: your letter 
#tr.en: extispicies I had performed. 
#tr.en: The lambs, about which you wrote me, 
#tr.en: after this my tablet, 
#tr.en: on the 3rd day, will reach you. 
#tr.en: Another thing: because of your house about which you wrote me, 
#tr.en: a while back, 
#tr.en: as follows you spoke to me, 
#tr.en: thus you: ‘2 houses 
#tr.en: I seized, 1 good house, 
#tr.en: I am keeping (lit. seizing) and 1 house I will release.’ 
#tr.en: This you said to me. 
#tr.en: Now (in) the house that your eye 
#tr.en: favors 
#tr.en: you will dwell; 
#tr.en: nobody your house 
#tr.en: will approach. 
#tr.en: To my lord 
#tr.en: speak! 
#tr.en: Thus Išḫi-Addu 
#tr.en: your servant: 
#tr.en: the sheep of the diviner which before the god 
#tr.en: he burned, his extispicy I saw; 
#tr.en: In that extispicy the ‛blinder’ 
#tr.en: at the ‛true spot’ was situated. 
#tr.en: The path was situated, and ... 
#tr.en: the mystery did not have the strength. 
#tr.en: The gate of the palace is well. 
#tr.en: In the duct of the shepherd 
#tr.en: a weapon-mark, and the shepherd followed it; 
#tr.en: the two bases of the shepherd, to the right, 
#tr.en: were sectioned, on the left torn out. 
#tr.en: The fortress on the left like a s.
#tr.en: was loose; 
#tr.en: The right of the finger was dark; 
#tr.en: the left of the finger was bound; 
#tr.en: the attachment was ...; 
#tr.en: the lungs were well; 
#tr.en: The knot to the right ... 
#tr.en: The upper parts were well. 
#tr.en: The dragon-face (is) the dragon-face of a man, 
#tr.en: the dragon-face of a man causing evil 
#tr.en: approached heaven (and) the clouds bring no rain. He approached the earth, and the plants do not grow. 
#tr.en: He approached the ox, and its yoke does not open, 
#tr.en: he approached the stall and smashes its cheese-pot. 
#tr.en: He approached the fold and destroys the flock. 
#tr.en: He approached the lad and sapped his (sexual) energies, 
#tr.en: he approached the maiden and tossed away her towel. 
#tr.en: He aproaches the nurse with (her) charge and cuts through the (child)-harness. 
#tr.en: Asarluhi took notice (and approached his father Enki ...): 
#tr.en: "What do I know that your do not already know?" 
#tr.en: Seven times, mix milled barley on the back of the grinding slab, 
#tr.en: Seven times, mix milled barley on the back of the mortar, 
#tr.en: together with fat. 
#tr.en: Bind it with leather. 
#tr.en: (Recite) the Eridu incantation. 
#tr.en: Bind it on the neck of the patient. 
#tr.en: May Nintinuga purify her (surgical) reed, 
#tr.en: may Damu strike with his axe, 
#tr.en: and may Gunura erect her boat-mast. 
#tr.en: tu-enuru.

#tr.en: Holy An, the great words of his mouth are not to be abrogated. 
#tr.en: The great gods bow down to him, like a curved staff, in approval of and in prayer to him.  
#tr.en: What you command is just. (Like) what a prince or lord has uttered, what you have commanded is obeyed. 
#tr.en: An, your lofty command takes precedence, who would say No to you? 
#tr.en: Father of the gods, your word, the foundation of heaven and earth, no god fails to heed it.  
#tr.en: Lord, you are the leader who takes only his own counsel, what should be our counsel? 
#tr.en: Grant your strength to the maiden Ištar, whom you have loved.   
#tr.en: Your reliable approval, weighty as heaven, make known (to her) in our assembly.  
#tr.en: Give to the mistress, whom you have loved, your combined divine powers.   
#tr.en: Let Kišar truly be the spouse equal with you, may she rise to the (equivalent) authority of your name.  
#tr.en: Moreover, in addition let her carry out herself the decrees of Enlil and Enki.    
#tr.en: When she alone has taken hold of the nose-rope of heaven and earth, she shall be our strength! 
#tr.en: For An, the pleasant conversation produced happiness.
#tr.en: He in his goodness of heart treated holy Inanna well.   
#tr.en: The commands of my Anu-ship are the complex fundament(?) of heaven which cannot be equaled.  
#tr.en: My fixed boundaries whose exteriors are fearsome and know no approaching, 
#tr.en: I am Anšar/Anu, the king's helper, do take hold of their band.   
#tr.en: Do take for yourself the entire extent of their territory, exercise alone the ruling of them!
#tr.en: Come, rise up to my dais of kingship and dwell in the heights!
#tr.en: Corresponding to my called name, may Exalted Kišar/Antu be your called name! 
#tr.en: My faithful vizier, whose lips are prized, who is aware of my secrets, 
#tr.en: Ninšubur, my fitting vizier, shall exercise the status of father with you. 
#tr.en: May he (standing) before you constantly present auspicious words from (every) god and goddess. 
#tr.en: At the eternal foundation of heaven and earth and by the enduring designs of the gods,  
#tr.en: when, in the beginning, Anu, Enlil and Ea allotted the shares, 
#tr.en: for the two gods, the watchmen of heaven and netherworld, the ones who open the door of Anu,
#tr.en: for moon-god and sun-god the night and day were made in equal parts, 
#tr.en: and from the bottom of heaven to the top of heaven they assign them their tasks: 
#tr.en: to keep all the stars of heaven on course as in a furrow, 
#tr.en: to make the leading gods keep to their paths like oxen. 
#tr.en: Up into that place, Inanna, rise to the rulership of them all! 
#tr.en: Lady, you be the brightest of them, so may they call you Ištar of the Stars!  
#tr.en: May your high position (relative to them) alternate between the two sides (east and west) triumphantly!
#tr.en: May your splendor be as abundant as that of the moon and sun in (their) watches. 
#tr.en: May the flaring glow of your torch shine high in the sky!  
#tr.en: May the people marvel at you as one for whom among the gods there is none to check up on her.
#tr.en: After the lord had bestowed (these) great powers upon the daughter of Sîn, 
#tr.en: he did not keep her away from the shrine Eanna, her sacred chamber.
#tr.en: After king Anu had bestowed the great powers upon her, 
#tr.en: they presented to her the shrine Eanna, her sacred chamber. 
#tr.en: He covered her figure with the ceremonial garment of Anu-hood, the brilliant splendor of Sîn.
#tr.en: He made her appear like the day with superb ornaments, the ornaments of divinity. 
#tr.en: He enhanced her arm with the scepter of kingship, the fierce wood (staff), the unsparing weapon.

#tr.en: and? [...] he imposed upon them. 
#tr.en: An ersatz of Esagila he made, [and ...] ... for Ur and the rest of the cultic centers, 
#tr.en: a ritual which was improper to them, an [unholy] display [offering x x x without] fear he daily recited. Irreverently, 
#tr.en: he put an end to the regular offerings (and) he interfered [in the cultic centers; ... he] established in the sacred centers. By his own plan, he did away with the worship of Marduk, the king of the gods, 
#tr.en: he continually did evil against Marduk’s city. Daily, [...] without interruption, he imposed the corvee upon its inhabitants unrelentingly, ruining them all. 
#tr.en: Upon hearing their cries, the lord of the gods became furiously angry and [...] their borders; the gods who lived among them forsook their dwellings, 
#tr.en: angry that he [sc. Nabonidus] had brought them to Babylon. Marduk, the exalted, [the lord of the gods], turned towards all the habitations that were abandoned and 
#tr.en: all the people of Sumer and Akkad, who had become corpses. He was reconciled and had mercy upon them. He examined and checked all the entirety of the lands, all of them, 
#tr.en: he searched everywhere and then he took a righteous king, his favorite, by the hand, he called out his name: Cyrus, king of Anshan; he pronounced his name to be king all over the world. 
#tr.en: He made the land of Gutium and all the Umman-manda [i.e., the Medes] bow in submission at his feet. And he [i.e., Cyrus] shepherded with justice and righteousness all the black-headed people, 
#tr.en: over whom he [i.e., Marduk] had given him victory. Marduk, the great lord, guardian of his people, looked with gladness upon his good deeds and upright heart. 
#tr.en: He ordered him to go to his city Babylon. He set him on the road to Babylon and like a companion and a friend, he went at his side. 
#tr.en: His vast army, whose number, like water of the river, cannot be known, marched at his side fully armed. 
#tr.en: He made him enter his city Babylon without fighting or battle; he saved Babylon from hardship. He delivered Nabonidus, the king who did not revere him, into his hands. 
#tr.en: All the people of Babylon, all the land of Sumer and Akkad, princes and governors, bowed to him and kissed his feet. They rejoiced at his kingship and their faces shone. 
#tr.en: Lord by whose aid the dead were revived and who had all been redeemed from hardship and difficulty, they greeted him with gladness and praised his name. 
#tr.en: I am Cyrus, king of the world, great king, mighty king, king of Babylon, king of Sumer and Akkad, king of the four quarters, 
#tr.en: the son of Cambyses, great king, king of Anshan, grandson of Cyrus, great king, king of Anshan, descendant of Teispes, great king, king of Anshan, 
#tr.en: of an eternal line of kingship, whose rule Bel and Nabu love, whose kingship they desire fot their hearts’ pleasure. When I entered Babylon in a peaceful manner, 
#tr.en: I took up my lordly abode in the royal palace amidst rejoicing and happiness. Marduk, the great lord, established as his fate for me a magnanimous heart of one who loves Babylon, and I daily attended to his worship. 
#tr.en: My vast army marched into Babylon in peace; I did not permit anyone to frighten the people of [Sumer] and Akkad. 
#tr.en: I sought the welfare of the city of Babylon and all its sacred centers. As for the citizens of Babylon, [... upon] whom he [i.e., Nabonidus] imposed a corvee which was not the gods’ wish and not befitting them, 
#tr.en: I relieved their weariness and freed them from their service. Marduk, the great lord, rejoiced over [my good] deeds. 
#tr.en: He sent gracious blessing upon me, Cyrus, the king who worships him, and upon Cambyses, the son who is [my] offspring, [and] upon all my army, 
#tr.en: and in peace, before him, we moved around in friendship. [By his] exalted [word], all the kings who sit upon thrones 
#tr.en: throughout the world, from the Upper Sea to the Lower Sea, who live in the districts [far-off], the kings of the West, who dwell in tents, all of them, 
#tr.en: brought their heavy tribute before me and in Babylon they kissed my feet. From [Babylon] to Assur and (from) Susa, 
#tr.en: Agade, Eshnunna, Zamban, Me-Turnu, Der, as far as the region of Gutium, the sacred centers on the other side of the Tigris, whose sanctuaries had been abandoned for a long time, 
#tr.en: I returned the images of the gods, who had resided there [i.e., in Babylon], to their places and I let them dwell in eternal abodes. I gathered all their inhabitants and returned to them their dwellings. 
#tr.en: In addition, at the command of Marduk, the great lord, I settled in their habitations, in pleasing abodes, the gods of Sumer and Akkad, whom Nabonidus, to the anger of the lord of the gods, had brought into Babylon. 
#tr.en: May all the gods whom I settled in their sacred centers ask daily 
#tr.en: of Bel and Nabu that my days be long and may they intercede for my welfare. May they say to Marduk, my lord: “As for Cyrus, the king who reveres you, and Cambyses, his son, 
#tr.en: [...].” The people of Babylon blessed my kingship, and I settled all the lands in peaceful abodes. 
#tr.en: I [daily increased the number offerings to n] geese, two ducks, and ten turledoves above the former offerings of geese, ducks, and turtledoves. 
#tr.en: [...] Dur-Imgur-Enlil, the great wall of Babylon, its defense, I sought to strengthen 
#tr.en: [...] The quay wall of brick, which a former king had built, [but had not] completed its construction, 
#tr.en: [...who had not surrounded the city] on the outside, which no former king had made, (who) a levy of workmen? [had led] into Babylon, 
#tr.en: [... with bitumen] and bricks, I built anew [and completed] their [job]. 
#tr.en: [... magnificent gates of cedar] with a bronze overlay, thresholds and door-sockets [cast in copper, I fixed in all] their [doorways]. 
#tr.en: [...] an inscription with the name of Assurbanipal, a king who had preceded [me, I] saw [in its midst]. 
#tr.en: [...] 
#tr.en: [...] for eternity.

#tr.en: you keep obsessing! 
#tr.en: Although you to me

#tr.en: and as to him, his mother 
#tr.en: in adoption
#tr.en: adopted him, 
#tr.en: yet although as to him,

#tr.en: There was a young man, a son of Nippur, destitute and poor; 
#tr.en: Gimil-Ninurta was his name, a miserable man, 
#tr.en: in his city Nippur exhausted he was living, and 
#tr.en: he had no silver fitting of his people, 
#tr.en: gold he had none fitting of the citizens; 
#tr.en: his storehouse thirsted for pure Nisaba (grain), 
#tr.en: for craving of bread his gut burned, 
#tr.en: for craving of meat and fine beer, miserable was his countenance. 
#tr.en: Daily with nothing to eat hungry he was lying; 
#tr.en: and he wore a garment without change, 
#tr.en: with his miserable heart he took counsel: 
#tr.en: “Let me strip off my garment without change, and 
#tr.en: in the square of my city Nippur a ram buy!” 
#tr.en: He stripped off his garment without change and 
#tr.en: in the square of his city Nippur a three year old nanny goat bought. 
#tr.en: with his miserable heart that one took counsel: 
#tr.en: “Perhaps in my courtyard I will slaughter the nanny goat, 
#tr.en: but there would be no banquet: where is the beer? 
#tr.en: They will hear of it, the neighbors of my gate, and will be enraged; 
#tr.en: kith and kin will be angry with me. 
#tr.en: Let me take and to the house of the mayor bring the nanny, 
#tr.en: a good and fair thing let me make delicious for his stomach!” 
#tr.en: Gimil-Ninurta grasped the nape of the nanny, 
#tr.en: to the gate of the mayor of Nippur that one approached, 
#tr.en: to Tukulti-Enlil, the keeper of the gate, words he speaks: 
#tr.en: “Speak!, that I may enter and see the mayor.” 
#tr.en: The doorman to his lord words speaks: 
#tr.en: “My lord, a son of Nippur waits at your gate, 
#tr.en: and as a greeting gift he brought you a nanny.” 
#tr.en: The mayor is angry with the doorman Tukulti-Enlil: 
#tr.en: “Why is a son of Nippur waiting at the gate?” 
#tr.en: the doorman to ... 
#tr.en: Gimil-Ninurta in the fullness of his heart entered before the mayor. 
#tr.en: Gimil-Ninurta before the mayor entering, 
#tr.en: in his left hand grasped the nape of his nanny, 
#tr.en: he raised his right hand greeting the mayor: 
#tr.en: “May Enlil and Nippur bless the mayor! 
#tr.en: May Adad and Nusku cause to flourish his seed!” 
#tr.en: The mayor to the son of Nippur the words speaks: 
#tr.en: “What is your loss, that a gift you are carrying?” 
#tr.en: Gimil-Ninurta to the mayor of Nippur his order relates: 
#tr.en: “Daily with nothing to eat hungry I was lying; 
#tr.en: so I tore off my garment of no change and 
#tr.en: in the square of my city Nippur I bought a three year old goat, 
#tr.en: to my miserable heart I thus spoke: 
#tr.en: “Perhaps in my courtyard I will slaughter the nanny, 
#tr.en: but there would be no banquet: where is the beer? 
#tr.en: they will hear of it, the neighbors of my gate, and will be enraged;
#tr.en: kith and kin will be angry with me; 
#tr.en: let me take and to the mayor bring the nanny!” 
#tr.en: Thus I spoke to my heart. 
#tr.en: ... the butcher was crying out at night(?); 
#tr.en: ... may they be captured(?); 
#tr.en: ... may it be overflowing, the table, 
#tr.en: ... 
#tr.en: ... he cried, and 
#tr.en: ... .
#tr.en: “Give to the son of Nippur bone and gristle, 
#tr.en: let him drink from your flask third-rate beer, and 
#tr.en: send him away and let him go out from the gate!” 
#tr.en: He gave him, the son of Nippur, bone and sinew, 
#tr.en: let him drink from his flask third-rate beer, and 
#tr.en: sent him away and let him leave through the gate. 
#tr.en: Gimil-Ninurta, through the gate leaving, 
#tr.en: to the doorman, the gatekeeper, the words speaks: 
#tr.en: “To your lord the blessings of the gods thus say to him! 
#tr.en: Because of the one burden you imposed on me,  
#tr.en: for the one, three I will repay you.” 
#tr.en: The mayor heard this and all day long laughed. 
#tr.en: Gimil-Ninurta to the palace of the king directed his face:
#tr.en: “On instruction of the king, prince and governor reach just judgment.” 
#tr.en: Gimil-Ninurta, before the king entering, 
#tr.en: bowed down, and kissed the ground before him. 
#tr.en: He raised his hands, the king of the universe greeting: 
#tr.en: “Ruler, life of the people, king strengthened by a guardian spirit, 
#tr.en: one chariot by your command let them give me, 
#tr.en: that for 1 day, whatever I wish I may achieve! 
#tr.en: For my day, my repayment shall be one mina of red gold.” 
#tr.en: He did not ask him, the king, “Your desire is what, 
#tr.en: that one chariot you would ride all day?” 
#tr.en: they gave to him a new chariot, fitting for grandees, 
#tr.en: they girded him with a new sash, fitting for ..., 
#tr.en: he mounted the new chariot, fitting for grandees, 
#tr.en: to his city, Duranki, he set his face. 
#tr.en: Gimil-Ninurta two birds caught, 
#tr.en: stuck in a box and sealed with his seal; 
#tr.en: to the gate of the mayor of Nippur that one went. 
#tr.en: The mayor before him went outside: 
#tr.en: “Who are you, my lord, that you drove here at dusk?” 
#tr.en: “The king, your lord, sent me to Duranki: 
#tr.en: “To Ekur, the house of Enlil, gold take!” 
#tr.en: The mayor, to offer an extravagant meal, slaughtered a pasillu; 
#tr.en: ditto (the mayor) before him “O, am I ever tired!” said to him. 
#tr.en: Gimil-Ninurta at the head of the mayor for the watch of the night (=first watch) sat; 
#tr.en: the mayor in his weariness was overcome by sleep; 
#tr.en: Gimil-Ninura in that of the night (=second watch) like a thief got up, and 
#tr.en: opened the gate of that same box, and the birds flew out to the heavens. 
#tr.en: The mayor, at the break of dawn, was shocked, ... 
#tr.en: “Open is the gate of the box, carried off is the gold!” 
#tr.en: Gimil-Ninurta, in the anguish of his heart, rent his garments. 
#tr.en: he set upon and the mayor let beg (for mercy), 
#tr.en: from his head to the soles of his feet 
#tr.en: his limbs he beat, vexation he imposed upon him. 
#tr.en: The mayor beneath him in dread was crying out: 
#tr.en: “My lord, a son of Nippur do not destroy! 
#tr.en: They gave him as his present two minas of red gold; 
#tr.en: instead of his garment that he rent, a second one he gave him. 
#tr.en: Gimil Ninurta through the gate exiting 
#tr.en: to Tukulti-Enlil, the gatekeeper, the words speaks: 
#tr.en: “To your lord the abundance of the gods, thus speak to him: 
#tr.en: “For the one load that you imposed upon me, 
#tr.en: one I have repaid you, two remain.” 
#tr.en: The mayor heard this, and all day wept. 
#tr.en: Gimil-Ninurta before the barber entered; 
#tr.en: he cut off all the hair on the left and ...; 
#tr.en: an n-vessel with the deposit of fire he filled, ..., 
#tr.en: to the gate of the mayor of Nippur that one went, 
#tr.en: to the doorman, the keeper of the gate, the words speaks: 
#tr.en: “Speak, that I would enter and see your lord.” 
#tr.en: “Who are you, that you would see him?” 
#tr.en: “A doctor, native of Isin, an examiner, am I! 
#tr.en: Where sickness and suffering in the body ...”. 
#tr.en: Gimil-Ninurta, before the mayor entering, 
#tr.en: where he (Gimil-Ninurta) his body had thrashed, he (GN) his bruises uncovered for him. 
#tr.en: The mayor to his eunuchs, “The doctor is able,” said. 
#tr.en: “My lord, in darkness do my cures make whole, 
#tr.en: where foot-traffic is removed, too dark for a pathway.” 
#tr.en: He let him enter ... a chamber, a place of no access, 
#tr.en: where friend or associate will not have pity on him; 
#tr.en: the n-vessel he threw into the heart of the fire. 
#tr.en: He drove into the hard earth five pegs, 
#tr.en: on hands, feet and head he bound him; 
#tr.en: from head to the sole of his feet his limbs he beat, vexation he imposed upon him. 
#tr.en: Gimil-Ninurta, through the gate exiting, 
#tr.en: to Tukulti-Enlil, the gatekeeper, the words speaks: 
#tr.en: “To your lord the abundance of the gods, thus speak to him: 
#tr.en: “For the 1 load that you imposed upon me, 
#tr.en: 2 I have repaid you, 1 remains.” 
#tr.en: Gimil-Ninurta was troubled, like a dog he lifted up his ears. 
#tr.en: he looked at the collective black-headed ones, observing all the young men; 
#tr.en: he caught one man ... of Nippur,
#tr.en: gave him as a gift ... a nanny:
#tr.en: “Go to the gate of the mayor of Nippur and set up a cry; 
#tr.en: at your cry let gather all the broad young men!” 
#tr.en: Gimil-Ninurta under the bridge crouched, like a dog. 
#tr.en: The mayor at the cry of the young man came outside, 
#tr.en: sent out the people of his house, female and male; 
#tr.en: they flew off in their entirety searching for the man; 
#tr.en: while they in their entirety ditto (were searching for the man), 
#tr.en: the mayor went outside alone. 
#tr.en: Gimil-Ninurta from below the bridge sprang, and seized the mayor. 
#tr.en: he put upon him, and the mayor caused to beg (for mercy);
#tr.en:  from his head to the soles of his feet 
#tr.en: his limbs he beat, vexation he imposed upon him: 
#tr.en: “Because of the one burden you imposed on me,
#tr.en:  3 I paid you back.” 
#tr.en:  He left him behind, and went out into the countryside; 
#tr.en: The mayor, crawling, entered the city.

#tr.en: decrees a destiny: 
#tr.en: “Your ‘walking to the fore in battle’ am I! 
#tr.en: Your ‘weapon carrier in combat like an attendant’ am I! 
#tr.en: Your ‘advocate in the assembly’ am I! 
#tr.en: Your ‘breath-giver in the campaign’ am I! 
#tr.en: Shepherd chosen by ... silver are you! 
#tr.en: King, good provider of Eanna are you. 
#tr.en: carneol of An’s Irigal are you! 
#tr.en: fir for running, 
#tr.en: fit to lift head in the august dais are you! 
#tr.en: fit to take a seat on the lapis throne, 
#tr.en: your head fit to wear a colorful, 
#tr.en: as to your body, fit to spread out a the fleece-garment, 
#tr.en: fit for stomach-hanging of the garment of royalty, 
#tr.en: fit to lift to the side the mitum-weapon, 
#tr.en: fit to open knees with mace, 
#tr.en: fit to send off straight the broad arrows, 
#tr.en: fit for throwing stick and shield bound to the hips, 
#tr.en: as to your hands, fit for silver staff, 
#tr.en: as to your feet, fit for silver sandals, 
#tr.en: You have knees! On the campaign, fit for running, 
#tr.en: fit for playing, like a calf of lapis, on my silver breast; 
#tr.en: May your loving stomach be lasting! 
#tr.en: An has doned this for you, may he never alter it! 
#tr.en: May Enlil, the decreer of fates, never change it!” 
#tr.en: So did Inanna caress him. 
#tr.en: He who knows the joyful heart of Ninegal 
#tr.en: sheared a black kid 
#tr.en: bathed a white kid; 
#tr.en: wild bulls of the mountains by their noses tied up 
#tr.en: —house of the august breeding bull roars— 
#tr.en: up to the young man Utu into the temple E-babbar brings, 
#tr.en: up to the young man Utu raising his radiant forehead, 
#tr.en: For Šulgi, good shepherd of Sumer, he decress a fate: 
#tr.en: “King, colorful words, sweet face, 
#tr.en: mighty hero, born to be a lion, 
#tr.en: young cow standing firm in its vigor, 
#tr.en: valiant, unbound in his strength, 
#tr.en: whose feet trample great mountains: 
#tr.en: the heroes of the foreign lands you have brought down, 
#tr.en: you have trampled upon all the thrones, 
#tr.en: your name to the edge of heaven you have established. 
#tr.en: Your king—to Ašimbabbar go in peace.” 
#tr.en: And so at Enegir, city built in splendor, 
#tr.en: did he not moor the boat? 
#tr.en: “Seed placed by the prince in the silver womb, born on the bright mountain, 
#tr.en: Ninazu, like a wild bull lowing in drink, 
#tr.en: ... 
#tr.en: ... 
#tr.en: ... 
#tr.en: ... 
#tr.en: ... 
#tr.en: ... 
#tr.en: ... 
#tr.en: ...” 
#tr.en: “... like date syrup, ghee ... 
#tr.en: your are hero! Come down from the revolting lands ... 
#tr.en: King, the lord of prayers and supplications chooses you by heart; 
#tr.en: shepherd Šulgi, the lord of prayers and supplications chooses you by heart; 
#tr.en: Who sets a king given strength by Enlil? 
#tr.en: Who enters to your ...? 
#tr.en: Who exits to your ...? 
#tr.en: ... who knows your stomach should not desire your strength. 
#tr.en: Having desired ... battle with you 
#tr.en: what escapes your outstretched arms? 
#tr.en: When like the thunder bird you shriek, who stands before you? 
#tr.en: When like the storm you howl, 
#tr.en: the foreign lands, open reeds ablaze, mountains trembling like reeds, 
#tr.en: in the houses of the foreign lands watching, 
#tr.en: Tidnum well marveled. 
#tr.en: Like Utu, your terror radiates in battle. 
#tr.en: Like Nergal, your mace drools in death 
#tr.en: your lance reaches into the blood of the Land. 
#tr.en: The great door of the city are you, the great wall of the Land are you! 
#tr.en: A net piled up over heaven and earth are you, lead-jenny positioned with Sumer are you, 
#tr.en: May your ... call in abundance! 
#tr.en: May the words of Enlil, enormous things, create shade on your head! 
#tr.en: May the loving heart Inanna never abandon you!” 
#tr.en: After Ninazu had called ... blessings again and again, 
#tr.en: he let ewes goodly produce endless lambs, 
#tr.en: let jennies goodly produce endless kids, 
#tr.en: let white cows set up calves, 
#tr.en: then before Nanna in his E-temen-ni-guru he enters with them, 
#tr.en: head held high in the most fitting house of the the royal household, in its royal offering place, the silver place. 
#tr.en: His king Ašimbabbar casts a joyous glance at him, 
#tr.en: for Šulgi, the good shepherd of Sumer, decreed a fate: 
#tr.en: “Hero, lord, mighty one of the foreign lands, right arm of the Land, 
#tr.en: you have achieved victory for me, have carried out the commandeds. 
#tr.en: The houses of the rebel lands that I have cursed you have reduced to ruin mounds. 
#tr.en: May you never grow weary of perfecting the divine powers for me every month at new moon! 
#tr.en: Like Ašnan, may your name be as sweet in the mouth of the Land and in the mouths of all the countries! 
#tr.en: May silver Ningal, lady of the Enunna, like the wooden frame of a waterskin spread out her lap for you! 
#tr.en: Thus did Suen decree a good fate. 
#tr.en: In the Egal-maḫ of Ninegal, he took his seat on the silver throne. 
#tr.en: The Ištaran of Sumer, omniscient from the womb, 
#tr.en: renders the judgments of the Land in due order, 
#tr.en: makes decisions for the Land in due order 
#tr.en: lets no strong man wrong the weak, 
#tr.en: lets mother speak sweetly to her child 
#tr.en: lets child answer truthfully to his father. 
#tr.en: Sumer is filled with abundance, 
#tr.en: Ur prolonged in splendor, 
#tr.en: ... establishes. 
#tr.en: Because the king exulted in his triumph and let his might radiate, 
#tr.en: his heroism set well, 
#tr.en: made the rebellious lands bow, 
#tr.en: made our city Ur raise neck in prosperity; 
#tr.en: king, adorned with a face of colorful lapis, son of Enlil; 
#tr.en: lifting up head to heaven in broad crown, 
#tr.en: with An in his lofty place taking counsel, sitting with Uraš on a big throne, 
#tr.en: manth and passing days making the Land of Sumer and all the foreign lands play joyously— 
#tr.en: praise be to Lord Ašimbabbar! 
#tr.en: praise be to Nisaba!

#tr.en: It was time to decide destinies in heaven and on earth, 
#tr.en: Lagash had raised the head towards heaven in large ‘me’, 
#tr.en: Enlil looked righteously upon Ningirsu. 
#tr.en: Did the ‘nig2-ul’ not emerge in our city? 
#tr.en: The ‘heart’, did it not return to its banks? 
#tr.en: The ‘heart’ of Enlil, did it not return to its banks? 
#tr.en: The ‘heart’, did it not return to its banks? 
#tr.en: The flood, did it not twinkle? Frightening (all). 
#tr.en: The ‘heart’ of Enlil, it is the river Tigris, did it not bring sweet water? 
#tr.en: To the house its king spoke: 
#tr.en: “I will make the ‘me’ of Eninnu emerge in heaven and on earth. 
#tr.en: The governor is wise, he shall pay attention. 
#tr.en: He shall place his hand on big things. 
#tr.en: He shall straighten the horns of perfect oxen, perfect goats.” 
#tr.en: The brick of deciding destinies lifted the head towards him, 
#tr.en: to build the shiny house it raised its neck towards him. 
#tr.en: It was then, in a ‘dark goat’, that towards his king, 
#tr.en: on the lord Ningirsu, Gudea looked. 
#tr.en: “Build his house!,” he ordered him. 
#tr.en: On Eninnu, whose ‘me’ is very large, 
#tr.en: he (Ningirsu) directed his (Gudea’s) eye there. 
#tr.en: Gudea, his ‘heart’ is distant, 
#tr.en: counseled about the message: 
#tr.en: “Let me, let me tell it to her, let me, let me tell it to her, 
#tr.en: may she stand by me in this case. 
#tr.en: I am the shepherd, princeliness was given to me. 
#tr.en: Of what my ‘dark goat’ has revealed to me, 
#tr.en: its ‘heart’ I did not know. 
#tr.en: Let me bring my dream to her, to my mother. 
#tr.en: My dream-interpreter, knowing ‘ku3’ on her own, 
#tr.en: Nanše, my divine sister from Siraran, 
#tr.en: may she make its meaning visible for me.” 
#tr.en: Did he not set foot on his barge? 
#tr.en: Towards Nina, on Ininadua, he directed the barge, 
#tr.en: he is breaking the waves of Ideḫula. 
#tr.en: After reaching Bagara—house hanging over the river, 
#tr.en: he sacrificed bread, he poured out cold water, 
#tr.en: he went to the king of Bagara, and prayed to him: 
#tr.en: “Hero, charging lion, having no rival, 
#tr.en: Ningirsu, boisterous in the Apsû, 
#tr.en: being noble in Nippur. 
#tr.en: Hero, you spoke to me, let me do it right for you, 
#tr.en: Ningirsu, let me build your house for you, 
#tr.en: let me make the ‘me’ perfect for you. 
#tr.en: Your sister, child born to Eridu, 
#tr.en: hero in her own right, lady-dream-interpreter of the gods, 
#tr.en: Nanše, my divine sister from Siraran, 
#tr.en: may she make the path right for me.” 
#tr.en: His (Gudea’s) prayer was being heard. 
#tr.en: From Gudea, his offering and his prayer, his king, 
#tr.en: the lord Ningirsu, received from him. 
#tr.en: In the House of Bagara he celebrated the week-festival. 
#tr.en: The governor set up his bed in the house of Gatumdu. 
#tr.en: He sacrificed bread, he poured out cold water. 
#tr.en: He went to Shiny-Gatumdu, 
#tr.en: (and then) he is saying an offering(!) to her: 
#tr.en: “My lady, child born by shiny An, 
#tr.en: princely in her own right, god with the raised head, 
#tr.en: living in the land, 
#tr.en: knowing ‘nig2-du7’ in her city. 
#tr.en: You are the lady, the mother, founder of Lagash. 
#tr.en: (With) your looking at the people: it is a bountiful wind. 
#tr.en: (With) your looking at the righteous hero, the man: for him life is prolonged. 
#tr.en: I am a no-mother-haver, you are my mother. 
#tr.en: I am a no-father-haver, you are my father. 
#tr.en: You have placed my semen in the inside: you bore me in the cella. 
#tr.en: Gatumdu, your shiny name is sweet. 
#tr.en: I will lay me down here this night, 
#tr.en: you are my big dagger, following my side. 
#tr.en: You are a reed, planted in the big water, 
#tr.en: you have placed life in me. 
#tr.en: You are a broad parasol, under your shade 
#tr.en: let me cool myself there. 
#tr.en: With the index finger? of your right hand, 
#tr.en: ‘stroke’ me with it my lady Gatumdu. 
#tr.en: I will go to the city, may my sign be good. 
#tr.en: To Nina, mountain raising out of the sea, 
#tr.en: may your good Utukku go in front of me, 
#tr.en: may your good Lamma follow in my path. 
#tr.en: Let me, let me tell it to her. 
#tr.en: Let me, let me tell it to her. 
#tr.en: May she stand by me in this case. 
#tr.en: Let me bring my dream to my mother, 
#tr.en: my dream-interpreter knowing ‘ku3’ by herself, 
#tr.en: Nanše, my divine lady from Siraran, 
#tr.en: may she make its meaning visible for me.” 
#tr.en: His cry was heard. 
#tr.en: His lady, the offering and the prayer, 
#tr.en: Shiny-Gatumdu received from Gudea. 
#tr.en: Did he not place the foot on the barge? 
#tr.en: To her city, Nina, he moored at the port of Nina. 
#tr.en: In the courtyard of the deity of Siraran the governor raised the head to heaven, 
#tr.en: he sacrificed bread, he poured out cold water. 
#tr.en: He went to Nanše, he prayed to her: 
#tr.en: “Nanše, large lady, lady of precious, precious, ‘me’. 
#tr.en: Lady, like Enlil deciding destinies. 
#tr.en: My Nanše, your word is righteous, 
#tr.en: it goes to the top. 
#tr.en: You are the dream interpreter of the gods. 
#tr.en: You are the lady of all the lands. Mother, my words, in the day, in the dream. 
#tr.en: Inside the dream there was one man, his greatness was like heaven, 
#tr.en: his greatness was like the earth. 
#tr.en: He, according to his head he was a god, 
#tr.en: according to his arm he was the Anzu, 
#tr.en: according to his lower body he was the flood. 
#tr.en: Lions lay by his right and left. 
#tr.en: He spoke to me about the building of his house. 
#tr.en: His ‘heart’ I did not understand. 
#tr.en: A light went up on the horizon for me. 
#tr.en: There was one woman. Who was it, who was it not? 
#tr.en: going up to the top she made a haystack on the earth. 
#tr.en: She held a stylus of purified silver in the hand. 
#tr.en: She had the tablet of the stars on her lap. 
#tr.en: She counseled it. 
#tr.en: Secondly, it was a hero, 
#tr.en: he bent the arm, he held a lapis writing board in the hand, 
#tr.en: he drew the plan of the house. 
#tr.en: In front of me stood a shiny basket, 
#tr.en: a shiny mold was made ready, 
#tr.en: the brick of deciding destinies was placed in the mold for me. 
#tr.en: In a just poplar standing in front of me, 
#tr.en: a ‘tibu’-bird passed the time tweeting. 
#tr.en: A donkey stallion, on the right side of my king, scratched the earth for me.” 
#tr.en: His mother, Nanše, answered the governor: 
#tr.en: “My shepherd, let me, me interpret your dream for you. 
#tr.en: The man (who was) great like the heaven, (who was) great like the earth, 
#tr.en: (who) according to his head (he was a) god, according to his arm 
#tr.en: (he was) the Anzu, according to his lower body the flood, 
#tr.en: at (whose) right and left lions were lying, 
#tr.en: it is surely my brother Ningirsu. 
#tr.en: ‘Build his shrine, the Eninnu!’ He ordered you. 
#tr.en: The light that went up for you on the horizon, 
#tr.en: it is your god Ningešzida, who like the light went up for you on the horizon. 
#tr.en: The virgin, going up to the top, making a haystack on the earth, 
#tr.en: holding a stylus of purified silver in her hand, 
#tr.en: placing the tablet of the stars on the lap, 
#tr.en: counseled it. 
#tr.en: That is surely Nisaba, my sister. 
#tr.en: (About) the shiny star of the building of the house, 
#tr.en: she poured out her voice for you. 
#tr.en: The second (one), it was a hero, with bent arm, 
#tr.en: holding in the hand a lapis drawing board, 
#tr.en: it is Nindubba, placing the house on the plan of the house. 
#tr.en: The shiny basket standing in front of you, the prepared shiny mold, 
#tr.en: the brick of deciding destinies, placed in the mold, 
#tr.en: that is surely the righteous brick of Eninnu. 
#tr.en: In the righteous poplar standing in front of you, 
#tr.en: a ‘tibu’-bird passed time tweeting, 
#tr.en: in order not to let sweet sleep come to your eyes, (so) that the house is build. 
#tr.en: A donkey stallion scratching the ground on your kings right side, 
#tr.en: that is you, scratching the ground for Eninnu like a ‘choice’ (?) (donkey-)span (?). 
#tr.en: Let me give give you instructions, let my instructions be heeded. 
#tr.en: (When) you have reached Girsu, the chief house of Lagash: 
#tr.en: after you broke the seal of your treasure house, after your brought out wood, 
#tr.en: after your have prepared a chariot for your king, 
#tr.en: after you harnessed the donkey stallion, 
#tr.en: after you decorated this chariot with purified silver and lapis, 
#tr.en: (called) ‘quick as light the arrow go out from the quiver’, 
#tr.en: after you have cared for ‘Ankara’, the ‘arm of heroism’, 
#tr.en: after you have fashioned his beloved emblem, 
#tr.en: after you wrote your name on it, 
#tr.en: his beloved harp, ‘dragon of the land’, 
#tr.en: the famous roaring wood, with which he counsels, 
#tr.en: to the hero who loves gifts, 
#tr.en: to your king, lord Ningirsu, 
#tr.en: after you entered for him into Eninnu, ‘the white Anzu bird’, with it, 
#tr.en: he will receive your small word, as if it was a mighty word. 
#tr.en: The ‘heart’ of the lord, distant like the heavens, 
#tr.en: of Ningirsu, son of Enlil, he will calm for you. 
#tr.en: He will reveal the plan of his house to you. 
#tr.en: The hero, his ‘me’ are the greatest, 
#tr.en: he shall let it grow for you.” 
#tr.en: The righteous shepherd Gudea 
#tr.en: learnt big, and now he will perform big. 
#tr.en: To the word Nanše spoke to him, 
#tr.en: he bowed his head. 
#tr.en: He broke the seal of his treasure house, 
#tr.en: he brought out wood. 
#tr.en: Gudea stood by the wood, 
#tr.en: he is caring for the wood. 
#tr.en: He made the top of the ‘mes’ wood good. 
#tr.en: He put the oak wood to the axe. 
#tr.en: He made it straight for him, for the lapis chariot. 
#tr.en: The donkey stallion, ‘lion called for running’, 
#tr.en: he harnesses for it. 
#tr.en: He fashioned his beloved emblem for him, 
#tr.en: he wrote his name on it. 
#tr.en: With his beloved harp, ‘dragon of the land’, 
#tr.en: the famous roaring wood, with which he councels, 
#tr.en: to the hero loving gifts, 
#tr.en: to his king, lord Ningirsu, 
#tr.en: in Eninnu, the white Anzu, 
#tr.en: he enters. 
#tr.en: Joyfully he entered to him in the house. 
#tr.en: Didn’t Gudea go out, brilliantly, from the shrine Eninnu? 
#tr.en: For the second (time), in(?) the house he passed the days, 
#tr.en: he passed the nights. 
#tr.en: He flattened the hills, he returned accusations. 
#tr.en: He removed the spittle from the dagger. 
#tr.en: To Šugalam, the terrible place, the place of rendering justice, 
#tr.en: the place of Ningirsu’s looking on all the lands, 
#tr.en: the governor, fattened(?) sheep, fat-tail sheep, fattened goats, 
#tr.en: un-fertilized sheep, in their hides, he brought in. 
#tr.en: Juniper, the pure tree of the mountain he placed on the fire, 
#tr.en: cedar incense, the incense of the gods, 
#tr.en: its smoke he made. 
#tr.en: He rose for his king in public, he prayed to him, 
#tr.en: he went to him in ‘ubšu-ukkina’, he greeted him: 
#tr.en: “My king, Ningirsu, lord holding back the terrible water, 
#tr.en: righteous lord, semen poured out by the ‘great mountain’. 
#tr.en: I am the youth not possessing guilt (?). 
#tr.en: Ningirsu, I will build your house for you, 
#tr.en: (but) my sign is my not. 
#tr.en: Hero you poured out the voice to me about the old order, 
#tr.en: son of Enlil, lord Ningirsu, 
#tr.en: I don’t understand its ‘heart’, 
#tr.en: your ‘heart’, surging, like the ocean, 
#tr.en: your, receding, like the wave, 
#tr.en: your roaring, like cascading water, 
#tr.en: like a flood, your crushing of cities, 
#tr.en: like the storm, your smashing of rebel lands, 
#tr.en: my king, your whirling water which cannot be held back, your ‘heart’. 
#tr.en: Hero, your remote, like the heaven, ‘heart’, 
#tr.en: son of Enlil, lord Ningirsu, 
#tr.en: I, what can I learn from you?” 
#tr.en: For the second (time), to the sleeping, to the sleeping, 
#tr.en: he stood by his head, he is touching his dagger: 
#tr.en: “(That which) you are building for me, (that which) you are building for me, 
#tr.en: Governor, the house you are building for me, 
#tr.en: Gudea, I will surely give you the sign of the building of my house. 
#tr.en: The shiny star of my ‘garza’ I will certainly proclaim for you. 
#tr.en: My house, Eninnu, founded by An, 
#tr.en: its ‘me’ is bigger than all the other enormous ‘me’ 
#tr.en: The king of the house gazes far. 
#tr.en: Like the Anzu, its shriek, 
#tr.en: makes the heaven tremble. 
#tr.en: Its terrible radiance reaches the heaven. 
#tr.en: The big fear of my house is spread on all the lands. 
#tr.en: At its name all the lands gather at the horizon. 
#tr.en: Magan (and) Meluhha will descend from their land. 
#tr.en: I Ningirsu, holding back the terrible water, 
#tr.en: the big hero in the place of Enlil, 
#tr.en: having no rival, 
#tr.en: I, the lord, have made my house, the Eninnu, bigger than a mountain. 
#tr.en: My weapon, ‘multitude-eraser’, which places the mountain in the hand, 
#tr.en: my terrible eye, which the lands cannot sustain, 
#tr.en: no-one shall leave my out-going out arm. 
#tr.en: My father and begetter, with love of greatness, 
#tr.en: the king, flood of Enlil, 
#tr.en: the border lands cannot sustain his terrible eye, 
#tr.en: Ningirsu, hero of Enlil, 
#tr.en: as name he named me. 
#tr.en: I collected the fifty ‘me’. 
#tr.en: I raised the offering table, 
#tr.en: I straightened the ‘šuluh’, 
#tr.en: I will raise my straightened hand to the shiny heaven for abundance: 
#tr.en: the things of my hand are sweetness. 
#tr.en: My father and begetter ate the sweetness, 
#tr.en: An, king of the gods, 
#tr.en: ‘Ningirsu, king, priest of An’, 
#tr.en: as name he named me. 
#tr.en: Tiraš, like Abzu, 
#tr.en: he founded in princeliness. 
#tr.en: Within it, with (each) moon, on the new moon day, 
#tr.en: he perfected for me greatly the very large ‘me’, my heavenly festival. 
#tr.en: Ehuš my Kihuš, 
#tr.en: like the Mušhuš(u-dragon?), he built on a frightening place. 
#tr.en: my rebellious place, which is not argued against, 
#tr.en: when my ‘heart’ has become angry with it, 
#tr.en: it produces poison for me like a poisonous snake. 
#tr.en: Ebabbar, place of my decisions, 
#tr.en: place of my sun-like shining, 
#tr.en: on that spot, I straighten the (law) cases of my city like Ištaran. 
#tr.en: In the house Bagara, the place of my table, 
#tr.en: the great gods of Lagash, 
#tr.en: assemble for me. 
#tr.en: My house, ‘chief house of all lands’, 
#tr.en: ‘right arm of Lagash’, 
#tr.en: ‘Anzu shrieking in all of heaven’, 
#tr.en: ‘Eninnu, my royal house’, 
#tr.en: righteous shepherd, Gudea, 
#tr.en: when your righteous hand caries it out, 
#tr.en: (when) you call the heaven for rain, 
#tr.en: I will let bounty come to you from the heaven. 
#tr.en: May people stretch out the hand in bounty with you. 
#tr.en: With the founding of my house, 
#tr.en: may abundance arrive. 
#tr.en: The great fields will lift the hand for you. 
#tr.en: The canals and the ditches will overflow their banks for you. 
#tr.en: Mounds that are never submerged, 
#tr.en: will be submerged for you. 
#tr.en: Sumer will pour out oil in excess with you, 
#tr.en: will weigh out wool in excess for you. 
#tr.en: When you place my platform for me, 
#tr.en: when you put your righteous hand to my house, 
#tr.en: the mountain, the place where the North-Wind rests, 
#tr.en: (when) you have reached it, 
#tr.en: the excessively strong male, the North-Wind, from the Mountain, the pure place, 
#tr.en: will straighten a wind for you. 
#tr.en: After I have given life to the people, 
#tr.en: a solitary man will work with another. 
#tr.en: At midnight the moon goes up for you, 
#tr.en: at midday the abundance of the sun goes up for you. 
#tr.en: I will build the house for you at day, 
#tr.en: at night I will let it grow for you. 
#tr.en: From below: oak, 
#tr.en: ‘peace’-tree will I bring down(!) to you. 
#tr.en: From above: cedar šurme-wood, zabalum-wood, by itself, 
#tr.en: from(?) the ebony-land, 
#tr.en: I will bring ebony for you. 
#tr.en: In the land of stone, large boulders of stone from the mountains, 
#tr.en: I will cut into blocks for you. 
#tr.en: On that day (when) your arm is touched with fire, 
#tr.en: I will teach you my sign.” 
#tr.en: Gudea rose, it was a dream. 
#tr.en: He is afraid, it was a dream. 
#tr.en: To Ningirsu’s spoken word, 
#tr.en: he bowed the head. 
#tr.en: He is stretching the hand in a white goat. 
#tr.en: He struck the hand into the goat, his goat is good. 
#tr.en: For Gudea, the ‘heart’ of Ningirsu 
#tr.en: it is the light, that dawned on him. 
#tr.en: He learned big, and now he will perform big. 
#tr.en: The governor, in his city, like a solitary man 
#tr.en: he regulated the rites. 
#tr.en: area-Lagash makes its ‘heart’ like one for him, like one mothers sons. 
#tr.en: He tore up trees, he weeded. 
#tr.en: He pruned, he returned accusations. 
#tr.en: He returned ‘sin’ to its house. 
#tr.en: He loosened the tongue of the whip (and) the [...], 
#tr.en: wool from a pregnant sheep he placed in the hand (of the overseer). 
#tr.en: A mother does not accuse a son, 
#tr.en: accusations, a son to his mother 
#tr.en: does not speak. 
#tr.en: The slave whose arm was touched by wood, 
#tr.en: his king does not smash his head. 
#tr.en: The slave girl, who a man wickedly made into booty, 
#tr.en: her lady did not thrown stuff in her face. 
#tr.en: To the governor, building Eninnu, 
#tr.en: to Gudea, no man brought accusations. 
#tr.en: The governor cleansed the city, 
#tr.en: he spun it with fire. 
#tr.en: An impure, a terrible one, a leper(?),

#tr.en: clad in joy, 
#tr.en:--standing to be admired. 
#tr.en: For the restoration of Eninnu 
#tr.en: Ningirsu be praised! 
#tr.en: The building of the house of Ningirsu, 
#tr.en: this is the middle of the praise. 
#tr.en: House, mooring post of the Land, 
#tr.en: grown up from earth to heaven, 
#tr.en: Eninnu, the good Brick for which Enlil has made a favorable firm promise, 
#tr.en: green mountain range, standing to be admired,

#tr.en: The House, being a great mountain, bordered on heaven, 
#tr.en: being the sun, it filled mid-heaven with light,

#tr.en: it (attacked) the mountain with spread wings. 
#tr.en: The people have all been settled (again), and the Land has gone home, 
#tr.en: (but) the Anunna gods are all standing in admiration. 
#tr.en: The ruler, who is wise, is knowledgeable, 
#tr.en: kisses the ground over and over before the divinities; 
#tr.en: with rites and prayer, in submission, he touches the ground; 
#tr.en: the ruler, the (personal) god of his city, says a prayer. 
#tr.en: For the bread-consuming House he added more bread, 
#tr.en: for the supper in need of mutton he added more sheep. 
#tr.en: As if it were for the abundance of vast midheaven, 
#tr.en: in front (of the House) he set up jars in a row. 
#tr.en: He went to the Anunna gods, 
#tr.en: prayed to them: “O all you Anunna gods who are admiring (what) the Land of Lagaš (achieved), 
#tr.en: protectors of all the countries, whose command, a torrent of water, 
#tr.en: will make the one who (would try to) stem it founder,  
#tr.en: (but) who to the worthy man upon whom they looked 
#tr.en: have given a long life, 
#tr.en: I, the shepherd, built the House, and my master will enter his House— 
#tr.en: would you, O Anunna gods, say a blessing on my behalf?” 
#tr.en: The true shepherd Gudea 
#tr.en: is wise and able, too, to realize things. 
#tr.en: His friendly guardian walks in front of him, 
#tr.en: and his friendly protecting genius is following him, 
#tr.en: (and so) to his master for the House of yore, the old House, his (former) abode, 
#tr.en: to the lord Ningirsu Gudea 
#tr.en: made great gifts. 
#tr.en: He went into Eninnu, to the lord, 
#tr.en: prayed to him: 
#tr.en: “My master Ningirsu, 
#tr.en: lord who has turned back the fierce waters, 
#tr.en: lord whose command takes precedence, 
#tr.en: Enlil’s male child, warrior, you spoke to me,  
#tr.en: and I did faithfully obey you. 
#tr.en: Ningirsu, I built you your House, 
#tr.en: may you enter it in joy.” 
#tr.en: (And he added) “My Baba, I erected your women’s quarters for you, 
#tr.en: move in in comfort.” 
#tr.en: His call was heard,  
#tr.en: the warrior accepted from Gudea, the lord Ningirsu 
#tr.en: accepted from him, prayer and rite. 
#tr.en: (Meanwhile) the year had ended, the month had been completed, 
#tr.en: the new year had appeared in the sky, 
#tr.en: the month “had entered its house,” 
#tr.en: and of that month the third day had passed: 
#tr.en: (Then) Ningirsu had arrived from Eridu, 
#tr.en: (and) the most beautiful moonlight shone 
#tr.en: illuminating the Land; Eninnu with the (new-)born moon (god) 
#tr.en: vied.
#tr.en: Gudea made a paste with carnelian and lapis lazuli, 
#tr.en: he put it in the corners 
#tr.en: and sprinkled abundant oil on the floor. 
#tr.en: He bade the builders, the workmen, 
#tr.en: leave the House. 
#tr.en: Syrup, butter oil, wine, sour milk, 
#tr.en: gipar-fruit, fig-cakes 
#tr.en: topped with cheese, 
#tr.en: dates in clusters(?), small grapes, 
#tr.en: (all) things untouched by fire, 
#tr.en: (to prepare) food for the gods, 
#tr.en: he used syrup and butter. 
#tr.en: From the moment when the sun rose in the good sky, 
#tr.en: Gudea, from early morning 
#tr.en: till supper (time) passed to and fro. 
#tr.en: Asari saw to it that the House was all right, 
#tr.en: Nin-mada gave advice, 
#tr.en: king Enki provided oracular messages. 
#tr.en: Nin-duba, foremost lustration priest of Eridu, 
#tr.en: filled (the House) with incense, 
#tr.en: the lady of precious rites, Nanše, who knows the words of sacred songs, put them to music for the House. 
#tr.en: She “sheared” the black ewes (of the sky), 
#tr.en: and of the cow-of-heaven  
#tr.en: she milked the udder, 
#tr.en: while with (brooms of) tamarisk and ...,
#tr.en: they were cleaning Eninnu 
#tr.en: until they had polished it to perfection. 
#tr.en: The ruler made the (whole) city kneel down, 
#tr.en: he made the Land prostrate itself. 
#tr.en: He leveled what was high, refused (to listen to) chance utterances,  
#tr.en: “spittle” (of sorcery) had been removed from the roads.  
#tr.en: In the city (only) the mother of a sick person 
#tr.en: administered a potion— the wild animals, creatures of the steppe, 
#tr.en: all had crouched together.  
#tr.en: Lion, lioness(?) and the “dragon of the steppe” 
#tr.en: enjoyed sweet sleep. 
#tr.en: Rites (had made) the day (go by), prayers the night, 
#tr.en: the early morning (had) the moonlight (caused to fade)—
#tr.en: was the master (of the House) on his way? 
#tr.en: (Yea,) the warrior Ningirsu was entering (his) House. 
#tr.en: The master of the House had come to it 
#tr.en: like an eagle catching sight of an aurochs. 
#tr.en: When the warrior was entering his House, 
#tr.en: he was a storm roaring towards battle, 
#tr.en: Ningirsu went about his House, 
#tr.en: and it was (just as) in the Abzu sanctuary when a festival is going on. 
#tr.en: The owner indeed came out of his House (again), 
#tr.en: and he was (like) the sun god rising above the land of Lagaš. 
#tr.en: When Baba went to her women’s quarters 
#tr.en: she was (like) a respectful woman caring for her house; 
#tr.en: when she entered her bedroom 
#tr.en: she was (like) the Tigris at high waters, 
#tr.en: when she sat down in ... 
#tr.en: she was the lady, daughter of bright An, a green garden bearing fruit. 
#tr.en: The day was about to rise, firm promise had been fulfilled, 
#tr.en: Baba had entered her women’s quarters—

#tr.en: The Anunna gods of the land of Lagaš were installed around the lord Ningirsu.

#tr.en: while Eninnu amassed ...

#tr.en: In the Eninnu sanctuary 
#tr.en: he had unblemished oxen and kids slaughtered. 
#tr.en: He put a jar in the open 
#tr.en: and poured much wine into it. 
#tr.en: The (harp) Dragon-of-the-Land he joined with the kettle drum(?), 
#tr.en: and the ala instruments sounded for him like a storm.  
#tr.en: Lo, the ruler on a ... 
#tr.en: stood, 
#tr.en: and his city gave him acclaim. 
#tr.en: Gudea ...
#tr.en: ... brought forth abundance for him. 
#tr.en: All places grew speckled barley for him. 
#tr.en: Lagaš under (its) ruler made abundance  
#tr.en: increase for him. 
#tr.en: (Now) that the warrior had moved into his new House, 
#tr.en: (Gudea) served a delicious banquet to the lord Ningirsu. 
#tr.en: He seated An at the place of honour for him,  
#tr.en: he made Enlil sit next to An 
#tr.en: and next to Enlil 
#tr.en: he seated Ninmaḫ. 
#tr.en: ... 
#tr.en: The owner rejoiced over the House, 
#tr.en: and he made a firm promise for the “brick” of Eninnu: 
#tr.en: “O brick of Eninnu, 
#tr.en: let something favorable be promised, 
#tr.en: brick of Eninnu, let it be promised, 
#tr.en: let something favorable be promised, 
#tr.en: House, a mountain founded in heaven, 
#tr.en: built as (your) very self, 
#tr.en: He determines the destiny of the brickwork of the Eninnu, 
#tr.en: he determines the brickwork's destiny, 
#tr.en: he determines a good destiny for the brickwork of the Eninnu:
#tr.en: "The temple that lets fear(?) fall like embers, set upon the earth and embracing heaven,   
#tr.en: ... holy ...
#tr.en: ... 
#tr.en: ... Let the cattle pens be built on your behalf, 
#tr.en: let the sheepfolds be renewed on your account. 
#tr.en: May the people lie down in safe pastures under your reign, (enjoying) abundance, 
#tr.en: and let the eyes of all the countries be directed toward Sumer. 
#tr.en: May the House, your Thunderbird, soar in the skies for your (benefit). 
#tr.en: ... 
#tr.en: ... 
#tr.en: ...
#tr.en: grown as tall as Gilgamesh, 
#tr.en: its throne set there no one shall remove. 
#tr.en: Your (personal) god is Ningešzida, grandson of An, 
#tr.en: your mother goddess is Ninsuna, the mother who bore healthy offspring 
#tr.en: and who loves (her) offspring. 
#tr.en: You are (the young) whom the dear cow has born, 
#tr.en: the faithful youth arisen from Lagaš, 
#tr.en: you are Ningirsu’s. 
#tr.en: May your name be famous from “Below” to “Above”. 
#tr.en: O Gudea, what you ordered,  
#tr.en: nobody ... shall pass over, 
#tr.en: you ... are a man known to An,
#tr.en: you are a faithful ruler to (whose) house a firm promise has been made. 
#tr.en: Gudea, son of Ningešzida, 
#tr.en: may life be prolonged for you.” 
#tr.en: O House that reaches to heaven like a great mountain, 
#tr.en: whose awe and aura are shed over the Land, 
#tr.en: (now) that An, that Enlil have made a firm promise for Lagaš, 
#tr.en: that about Ningirsu’s reputation 
#tr.en: all countries have learned 
#tr.en: that Eninnu is joined both to heaven and earth— 
#tr.en: praise be unto Ningirsu! 
#tr.en: Of (the composition) “Ningirsu’s House having been built” 
#tr.en: (this) is the end of the praising hymn.

#tr.en: and who the divine power of Ningirsu 
#tr.en: shall thereby diminish, 
#tr.en: may his regular offerings 
#tr.en: within the temple of Ningirsu 
#tr.en: be revoked 
#tr.en: and all his pronouncements be blocked! 
#tr.en: For Ningirsu, 
#tr.en: strong hero 
#tr.en: of Enlil, 
#tr.en: Gudea, 
#tr.en: he of lasting fame, 
#tr.en: ruler

#tr.en: Gudea 
#tr.en: to the statue 
#tr.en: gives (these) words: 
#tr.en: Statue, to my master 
#tr.en: do say thus: 
#tr.en: When the Eninnu, 
#tr.en: his beloved temple, 
#tr.en: I built for him, 
#tr.en: I had debts remitted and I washed all hands. 
#tr.en: For seven days no barley was ground. 
#tr.en: The slave woman was made equal with her mistress, 
#tr.en: and by the slave 
#tr.en: his master stood side by side. 
#tr.en: In my city the sexually impure with respect to him (Ningirsu) 
#tr.en: I made to go out to sleep at the edge of it. 
#tr.en: Evil to its house 
#tr.en: I made go back. 
#tr.en: To the laws 
#tr.en: of Nanše 
#tr.en: and Ningirsu 
#tr.en: I attended. 
#tr.en: An orphan I did not let be put under the control of a rich person. 
#tr.en: and a widow I did not let be put under the control of a powerful person. 
#tr.en: For an estate not having a son, 
#tr.en: a daughter of it its heir 
#tr.en: I made become. 
#tr.en: The stone statue 
#tr.en: he made receptive to messages. 
#tr.en: This statue 
#tr.en: is neither of silver, nor is it of lapis lazuli. 
#tr.en: It is neither of copper nor of tin, 
#tr.en: nor is it of bronze. 
#tr.en: No one must put it to any other use, 
#tr.en: and so it is (made only of) diorite. 
#tr.en: Let it stand at the place of libations. 
#tr.en: By an act of force 
#tr.en: let no one destroy it. 
#tr.en: O statue, before you 
#tr.en: is (standing a statue) of Ningirsu! 
#tr.en: The statue 
#tr.en: of Gudea, 
#tr.en: the ruler 
#tr.en: of Lagash, 
#tr.en: the man by whom the Eninnu 
#tr.en: of Ningirsu 
#tr.en: was built-
#tr.en: any person who from the Eninnu 
#tr.en: shall remove it, 
#tr.en: or its inscription 
#tr.en: shall erase from it, 
#tr.en: or any person who shall destroy it; 
#tr.en: at the beginning of a good year, 
#tr.en: a (future) person whom, as did my god, 
#tr.en: his (own) god 
#tr.en: Ningirsu, 
#tr.en: my master, 
#tr.en: has called to from among all the people, 
#tr.en: who (then) my judgments 
#tr.en: shall overturn, 
#tr.en: my gifts 
#tr.en: would revoke, 
#tr.en: and from my collected songs 
#tr.en: having displaced my name 
#tr.en: shall set his own name on them; 
#tr.en: who in the courtyard of Ningirsu my master 
#tr.en: shall abandon its established shrines, 
#tr.en: without having kept before his eyes 
#tr.en: that since days of old, 
#tr.en: since the seed (first) emerged, 
#tr.en: when a ruler 
#tr.en: of Lagash, 
#tr.en: the Eninnu 
#tr.en: for Ningirsu 
#tr.en: my master 
#tr.en: had built-
#tr.en: being a person who had made a fitting thing come forth resplendently-
#tr.en: his words 
#tr.en: no one shall ever alter, 
#tr.en: nor ever overturn his judgments. 
#tr.en: Therefore regarding Gudea, 
#tr.en: the ruler 
#tr.en: of Lagash, 
#tr.en: anyone who shall alter his word, 
#tr.en: or shall overturn his judgments, 
#tr.en: may An, 
#tr.en: Enlil, 
#tr.en: Ninhursaga, 
#tr.en: Enki, he of the righteous utterance, 
#tr.en: Suen, whose name no one can explain, 
#tr.en: Ningirsu, 
#tr.en: the king of weaponry, 
#tr.en: Nanše, 
#tr.en: the mistress of the boundary marker, 
#tr.en: Nindara, 
#tr.en: the king and warrior,

#tr.en: the holy Gatumdu, 
#tr.en: Baba, 
#tr.en: the lady, the eldest daughter of An, 
#tr.en: Inanna, 
#tr.en: the lady of battle, 
#tr.en: Utu, 
#tr.en: the king of greenery, 
#tr.en: Hendursag, 
#tr.en: the herald of the nation, 
#tr.en: Igalima 
#tr.en: and Šulšagana, 
#tr.en: Ninmar, 
#tr.en: the eldest daughter of Nanše, 
#tr.en: Dumuzi'abzu, 
#tr.en: the mistress of Kinunir, 
#tr.en: and my (personal) god Ningešzida, 
#tr.en: may they all change his fate. 
#tr.en: Like an ox 
#tr.en: may he be slaughtered in his noonday (prime). 
#tr.en: Like an aurochs 
#tr.en: may he be seized by his fierce horns. 
#tr.en: May his throne which people had set up for him 
#tr.en: be made to sit out in the dust. 
#tr.en: If 
#tr.en: to erasing this inscription 
#tr.en: he should set his mind, 
#tr.en: let his own name in the house of his god 
#tr.en: from the tablets be removed. 
#tr.en: May his own god 
#tr.en: not look upon the settled(?) people. 
#tr.en: May he hold back the rain in the sky 
#tr.en: and hold back the waters upon the earth. 
#tr.en: May years of dearth stretch out for him, 
#tr.en: and may there be famine during his reign. 
#tr.en: That person, 
#tr.en: like a man who does evil to a righteous person, 
#tr.en: may that one’s end produce a shutting(?) in heaven, 
#tr.en: and may it not be released. 
#tr.en: Of the most forceful of all the gods, 
#tr.en: of lord Ningirsu, 
#tr.en: may his greatness 
#tr.en: be known by the nation. 
#tr.en: Ningešzida 
#tr.en: is the (personal) god of Gudea, 
#tr.en: the ruler 
#tr.en: of Lagash, 
#tr.en: the man by whom the Eanna (temple) 
#tr.en: was built.

#tr.en: he of lasting fame, 
#tr.en: the ruler 
#tr.en: of Lagash, 
#tr.en: the man by whom the Eninnu

#tr.en: was built-
#tr.en: when Inana 
#tr.en: her eye of life 
#tr.en: she had sent out towards him, 
#tr.en: Gudea, 
#tr.en: the ruler 
#tr.en: of Lagash, 
#tr.en: being of broad intelligence 
#tr.en: and a slave by his mistress 
#tr.en: beloved, 
#tr.en: in the shed of the brick mold 
#tr.en: he made the design, 
#tr.en: and by the excavation 
#tr.en: he made the standards gleam. 
#tr.en: The clay for it on a pure place 
#tr.en: he mixed together, 
#tr.en: and the bricks for it 
#tr.en: onto a clean place 
#tr.en: he let fall out. 
#tr.en: Its foundation plot he sanctified 
#tr.en: and refined with fire. 
#tr.en: Its foundation pegs 
#tr.en: with oil of princely scent 
#tr.en: he adorned. 
#tr.en: Her beloved temple, 
#tr.en: the Eanna, in the center of Girsu 
#tr.en: he built for her. 
#tr.en: From the mountains of Magan 
#tr.en: he brought down diorite 
#tr.en: and into (this) his stone figure 
#tr.en: he formed it. 
#tr.en: Gudea, 
#tr.en: the temple builder, 
#tr.en: may his life be long! 
#tr.en: he named it for her, 
#tr.en: and into the Eanna 
#tr.en: he had it brought to her. 
#tr.en: A person who from the Eanna 
#tr.en: shall remove it, 
#tr.en: or who shall destroy it, 
#tr.en: or erase its inscription, 
#tr.en: Inana, 
#tr.en: the mistress of all the lands, 
#tr.en: his head in the assembly 
#tr.en: may she curse. 
#tr.en: The throne that he has erected, 
#tr.en: its foundations 
#tr.en: may she not keep secure. 
#tr.en: May she make his seed come to an end 
#tr.en: and cut short his reign. 
#tr.en: For Ningirsu, 
#tr.en: the mighty warrior 
#tr.en: of Enlil, 
#tr.en: his master. 
#tr.en: Gudea,

#tr.en: This statue,
#tr.en: its silver and lapis lazuli 
#tr.en: Envoys of Aga, the son of Enmebaragesi, 
#tr.en: from Kish to Gilgamesh in Uruk came. 
#tr.en: Gilgamesh before the elders of his city, 
#tr.en: presented the issue, carefully choosing his words: 
#tr.en: There are wells to be finished, wells of the Land yet to be finished; 
#tr.en: there are shallow wells of the Land yet to be finished, 
#tr.en: there are wells to deepen and hoisting gear to be completed. 
#tr.en: To the house of Kish We should not submit! Should we not smite it with weapons? 
#tr.en: In the convened assembly, the elders of his city 
#tr.en: answer Gilgamesh: 
#tr.en: “There are indeed wells to be finished, wells of the Land yet to be finished; 
#tr.en: there are shallow wells of the Land yet to be finished, 
#tr.en: there are wells to deepen and hoisting gear to be completed. 
#tr.en: So we should submit to the house of Kish. We should not smite it with weapons! 
#tr.en: Gilgamesh, the lord of Kulaba, 
#tr.en: in Inanna placing his trust 
#tr.en: the advice of the elders of his city did not take seriously. 
#tr.en: a second time Gilgamesh before the able-bodied men of his city 
#tr.en: presented the issue, carefully choosing his words: 
#tr.en: “There are wells to be finished, wells of the Land yet to be finished; 
#tr.en: there are shallow wells of the Land yet to be finished, 
#tr.en: there are wells to deepen and hoisting gear to be completed. 
#tr.en: Never before have you submitted to the house of Kish. Should you not smite it with weapons? 
#tr.en: In the convened assembly, the able-bodied men of his city answer Gilgamesh: 
#tr.en: “Standing on duty and sitting in attendance, 
#tr.en: the son of the king escorting, 
#tr.en: the reins of the donkey always grasping, 
#tr.en: who has the breath?,” as the saying goes. 
#tr.en: To the house of Kish you all should not submit! With weapons should we not smite it?” 
#tr.en: “The structure of Uruk, the handiwork of the gods, 
#tr.en: and of Eanna, the house from heaven lowered down, 
#tr.en: the great gods created. 
#tr.en: The great wall, the wall which An founded, 
#tr.en: the majestic residence which An established, 
#tr.en: you watch over. You are its king and warrior, 
#tr.en: an exuberant person, a prince by An beloved. 
#tr.en: When Aga comes, what terror he will experience! 
#tr.en: That army is small, at the rear scattered. 
#tr.en: Its men will be incapable of confronting us.” 
#tr.en: Then Gilgamesh, the lord of Kulaba, 
#tr.en: at the advice of the able-bodied men of his city rejoiced and his spirit brightened. 
#tr.en: His servant Enkidu he addressed: 
#tr.en: “On this account let the weaponry and arms of battle be made ready. 
#tr.en: Let the battle mace to your side return. 
#tr.en: A great terror and radiance may they create. 
#tr.en: When he comes, my great fearsomeness will overwhelm him. 
#tr.en: His reasoning will become confused, his judgment disarrayed.” 
#tr.en: Not 5 days, not 10 days had passed 
#tr.en: when Aga, the son of Enmebaragesi, to Uruk with his men laid siege . 
#tr.en: Uruk’s reasoning became confused. 
#tr.en: Gilgamesh, the lord of Kulaba, 
#tr.en: to its warriors speaks: 
#tr.en: “My warriors shall have the choice. 
#tr.en: Let someone with courage rise up, “I shall go against Aga” 
#tr.en: Birḫurtura, his royal guard, 
#tr.en: in admiration to his king says: 
#tr.en: I shall go against Aga. 
#tr.en: so that his reasoning will become confused, his judgment disarrayed.” 
#tr.en: Birḫurtura through the city gate went out. 
#tr.en: As soon as Birḫurtura went out through the city gate, 
#tr.en: at the gate of the city gate they captured him, 
#tr.en: Birḫurtura’s entire length beating. 
#tr.en: Into the presence of Aga he came 
#tr.en: speaking to Aga. 
#tr.en: His words were not done, a “mirror-holder” of Uruk, on the wall climbing up, 
#tr.en: out over the wall leaned. 
#tr.en: Aga trained his eyes, 
#tr.en: to Birḫurtura speaking: 
#tr.en: “Slave, is that man your king?” 
#tr.en: “That man is not my king! 
#tr.en: Were that man my king, 
#tr.en: were that his angry brow, 
#tr.en: were those his bison eyes, 
#tr.en: were that his lapis lazuli beard, 
#tr.en: were those his elegant fingers, 
#tr.en: would he not cast down multitudes? Would he not raise up multitudes? 
#tr.en: Would multitudes not be smeared with dust? 
#tr.en: Would not all the nations be overwhelmed? 
#tr.en: Would not the (canal-)mouths of the land be filled with silt? 
#tr.en: Would not the horns of the barges be broken? 
#tr.en: Would he not take captive Aga, the king of Kish, in the midst of his army?” 
#tr.en: Hitting him, striking him, 
#tr.en: Birḫurtura’s entire length they were beating. 
#tr.en: After the “mirror-holder” of Uruk, Gilgamesh climbs up on the wall. 
#tr.en: the young and old of Kulaba his radiance overwhelms. 
#tr.en: The able-bodied men of Uruk with battle maces he armed, 
#tr.en: on the causeway at the door of the city gate stationed. 
#tr.en: Enkidu through the city gate alone went out. 
#tr.en: Gilgamesh out over the wall leaned. 
#tr.en: Looking up, Aga opened his eyes: 
#tr.en: “Slave, is that man your king?” 
#tr.en: “That man is indeed my king.” 
#tr.en: It was just as he had said: 
#tr.en: Multitudes fell, multitudes rose up, 
#tr.en: multitudes with dust were smeared, 
#tr.en: all the nations were overwhelmed, 
#tr.en: the (canal-)mouths of the land with silt were filled, 
#tr.en: the horns of the barges were broken, 
#tr.en: Aga, the king of Kish, in the midst of his army he took captive 
#tr.en: Gilgamesh, the lord of Kulaba, 
#tr.en: to Aga speaks: 
#tr.en: “Aga my foreman, Aga my lieutenant, 
#tr.en: Aga my commander of the troops! 
#tr.en: Aga gave me breath, Aga gave me life: 
#tr.en: Aga a fugitive into his embrace took, 
#tr.en: Aga the fleeing bird with grain provided.” 
#tr.en: “Uruk, the handiwork of the gods, 
#tr.en: the great wall, the wall which An founded, 
#tr.en: the majestic residence which An established, 
#tr.en: you watch over. You are its king and warrior, 
#tr.en: an exuberant person, a prince beloved of An.” 
#tr.en: “Before Utu, your former kindness is hereby repaid to you.” 
#tr.en: Aga to Kish he set free. 
#tr.en: As to Gilgamesh, lord of Kulaba, 
#tr.en: your praise is sweet. 
#tr.en: Enlil! Gutium, 
#tr.en: the fanged snake of the mountain ranges, 
#tr.en: a people who acted violently against the gods, 
#tr.en: people who the kingship 
#tr.en: of Sumer 
#tr.en: to the mountains took away, 
#tr.en: who Sumer 
#tr.en: with wickedness filled, 
#tr.en: who from one with a wife his wife 
#tr.en: took away from him, 
#tr.en: who from one with a child his child 
#tr.en: took away from him, 
#tr.en: who wickedness and violence 
#tr.en: produced within the country— 
#tr.en: Enlil, the king of all the lands, 
#tr.en: to obliterate its name, 
#tr.en: Utuḫegal, 
#tr.en: the mighty man, 
#tr.en: the king of Uruk, 
#tr.en: the king of the four world quarters, 
#tr.en: the king whose utterances cannot be countermanded, 
#tr.en: Enlil, the king of all the lands, 
#tr.en: issued to him a command about this. 
#tr.en: To Inanna his lady 
#tr.en: he went 
#tr.en: and prayed to her, (saying) 
#tr.en: “My lady, lioness of battle, 
#tr.en: who the foreign lands batters, 
#tr.en: Enlil, the kingship of Sumer 
#tr.en: to return to its own control 
#tr.en: he commanded me. 
#tr.en: May you be my ally.” 
#tr.en: An army of many foreigners 
#tr.en: bore down upon the land everywhere. 
#tr.en: Tirigan, 
#tr.en: the king of Gutium, 
#tr.en: opened its (canal?) mouths, 
#tr.en: but no one came out against him. 
#tr.en: Both banks of the Tigris 
#tr.en: he had seized. 
#tr.en: To the south, in Sumer, 
#tr.en: the cultivated land he tied up, 
#tr.en: to the north, the roads he tied up. 
#tr.en: On the highways of the country 
#tr.en: he made tall grasses grow. 
#tr.en: But the king to whom Enlil 
#tr.en: had given power, 
#tr.en: whom Inanna by (her own) heart had chosen, 
#tr.en: Utuḫegal, the mighty man, 
#tr.en: from Uruk went out against him. 
#tr.en: In the temple of Iškur 
#tr.en: he made an offering. 
#tr.en: To the citizens of his city 
#tr.en: he was calling out, (saying) 
#tr.en: “Gutium 
#tr.en: Enlil has given to me. 
#tr.en: My mistress Inanna 
#tr.en: is my ally. 
#tr.en: Dumuzi-Ama’ušumgalana 
#tr.en: has declared ‛It is something that concerns me,’ 
#tr.en: and Gilgameš, 
#tr.en: the son of Ninsun, 
#tr.en: as bailiff he has given to me.” 
#tr.en: The citizens of Uruk 
#tr.en: and the citizens of Kullab 
#tr.en: he caused to rejoice at this. 
#tr.en: His city, as one man, 
#tr.en: followed after him. 
#tr.en: The military contingents and scouts 
#tr.en: he put in good order. 
#tr.en: After having departed from the temple of Iškur, 
#tr.en: on the 4th day in Nagsu on the Enurigal canal 
#tr.en: he made an offering. 
#tr.en: On the 5th day at Bara-Ilitappe 
#tr.en: he made an offering. 
#tr.en: Ur-Ninazu 
#tr.en: and Nabi-Enlil, 
#tr.en: generals of Tirigan

#tr.en: Through the strength of the land 
#tr.en: I completed that work. 
#tr.en: By means of the commands and divine decisions 
#tr.en: of the great gods 
#tr.en: the Tigris, the wide river,

#tr.en: to make bear tribute
#tr.en: and set it down at his feet and his hands, 
#tr.en: their holy word, which cannot be altered, 
#tr.en: they firmly spoke. 
#tr.en: At that time, Ašimbabbar, 
#tr.en: wise as to decisions, the son of Ninlil, 
#tr.en: who before An and Enlil 
#tr.en: in beauty had come forth head held high, 
#tr.en: who soothes the land with his word, 
#tr.en: who has faithfully manifested it to the Black Headed People,  
#tr.en: and has shown compassion to its numerous people, 
#tr.en: in his city Ur, the weak(?) mother of the land, 
#tr.en: with his shining brow and happy heart
#tr.en: he(?) looked at her(?),
#tr.en: and having raised his head  
#tr.en: he made it acquire an exalted name. 
#tr.en: Letting it have the use of the abundance of the sea and mountains 
#tr.en: and (as well) making it rush into war and battle in the nation,   
#tr.en: he gave it as a gift.
#tr.en: To provide refuge for the living, 
#tr.en: to return what was their land to their control, 
#tr.en: to establish water therein, and (so) to prolong their lives 
#tr.en: by their word they brought him to do this. 
#tr.en: For this, Warad-Sîn, 
#tr.en: me, the wise one possessing intelligence, who loves what is right, 
#tr.en: me who was colored(?) in sacred fashion from the very womb of my mother, 
#tr.en: he (Nanna) placed me in the position of shepherd in his land. 
#tr.en: For my rectitude he gave me the scepter, 
#tr.en: bestowed upon me a happy reign, 
#tr.en: and made his numerous people dwell under my command.  
#tr.en: To renovate the Etemenniguru temple, 
#tr.en: to thicken the base(?) of the shrine Ebabbar, 
#tr.en: to rebuild the cities of the gods of the land, 
#tr.en: to ... their fallen ...
#tr.en: to raise high the old divine plans, 
#tr.en: to restore their forgotten lustration rites,
#tr.en: Nanna, the lord who perfects the divine attributes of heaen and earth, 
#tr.en: because of my reverence he ordered me to do this. 
#tr.en: My counsel for that(?) is a superior thing,  
#tr.en: my skillful care is a thing that cannot be disrupted. 
#tr.en: About lettiing my people know the ways of my kingship 
#tr.en: about making my greatness and majesty exist forever, 
#tr.en: about widening Ur,   
#tr.en: expanding its platform,
#tr.en: and greater than previously  
#tr.en: enlarging its grounds,  
#tr.en: after I had inquired about these (things), I trod after him 
#tr.en: and humbly I addressed pleas to him.
#tr.en: Nanna, my master, was agreeable to me. 
#tr.en: For my life and the life 
#tr.en: of Kudur-mabuk, the father who begot me - 
#tr.en: the city, the mountain of life and place of abundance, 
#tr.en: the residence and assembly (place) of the gods, 
#tr.en: whose destiny they (the gods) having decided, 
#tr.en: whose name is surpassing, 
#tr.en: with top reaching the heavens, 
#tr.en: whose arms seek with the hands the put inquiries, 
#tr.en: whose wide shadow covers foreign land as well as the nation, 
#tr.en: from whose good base the Black Headed People 
#tr.en: he has multiplied, those who betake their lives (there) -
#tr.en: the building of its wall he placed in my hands.  
#tr.en: In the middle of that, five months had not elapsed 
#tr.en: when I had baked its bricks.
#tr.en: I finished that great wall 
#tr.en: and raised up its parapets. 
#tr.en: Like a verdant mountain range I made it grow on a pure place. 
#tr.en: Its height I made surpassing and set free its awesome radiance. 
#tr.en: Commensurate with its name and greatness I raised up its top. 
#tr.en: As a marvel of the nation 
#tr.en: I made it grandly resplendent.  
#tr.en: In its foundations, for the foundation documents of my kingship 
#tr.en: I sought out the place. 
#tr.en: I raised the top of its main gate. 
#tr.en: I strengthened its demarcating levee, 
#tr.en: circled it with bricks, 
#tr.en: and dug its moat. 
#tr.en: I heaped up its ... 
#tr.en: When the wall of Ur 
#tr.en: I built, 
#tr.en: the wages for one man were: 3 ban barley, 
#tr.en: 2 sila bread, 2 sila beer, 2 shekels oil, 
#tr.en: in one day a man received thus. 
#tr.en: From the midst of my land 
#tr.en: I removed (cause for) complaint. 
#tr.en: With my shining brow and happy heart 
#tr.en: I finished this work quickly and joyfully. 
#tr.en: With my wide intelligence and wisdom I did the work in grand fashion. 
#tr.en: That wall: Nanna Makes Firm the Foundations of the Land 
#tr.en: I named it.
#tr.en: For my deeds, O Nanna my master, may you rejoice over me,

#tr.en: for this, to Inanna, 
#tr.en: as I made fine words (of prayer), 
#tr.en: a vessel of diorite stone
#tr.en: suitable for pure touching-water - 
#tr.en: something which previously no queen who came before me

#tr.en: when I had fashioned it, 
#tr.en: at the sacred gate of the main courtyard of the Emeurur temple 
#tr.en: a place of marvel of the nation 
#tr.en: I happily set it up . 
#tr.en: In order from evil-doers and violent men  
#tr.en: to keep Lirīš-gamlum away,  
#tr.en: and the asakku or ašbur diseases that may be in her body 
#tr.en: to give over (instead) to that which knows not fear, 
#tr.en: to remove the šahal from within her eye, 
#tr.en: and to act as guardian for her life, 
#tr.en: for the life of Lirīš-gamlum my daughter 
#tr.en: and for my own life, 
#tr.en: I, the servant who has fear of her (Inanna),
#tr.en: dedicated it (this object) to her.
#tr.en: For ever after today,  
#tr.en: a person who may efface the work I have made, 
#tr.en: who shall remove it from its standing place 
#tr.en: and stand it up in another place, 
#tr.en: who shall erase its inscription 
#tr.en: and inscribe his own name upon it, 
#tr.en: or because of this curse 
#tr.en: shall incite a stranger to it,  
#tr.en: upon that person may Inanna, queen of all the lands, 
#tr.en: with her angry heart and fury  
#tr.en: wreak upon him a grievous curse.

#tr.en: With a marsh 
#tr.en: he caused it to be surrounded. 
#tr.en: The Euphrates 
#tr.en: he dug, and 
#tr.en: the banks of the Euphrates

#tr.en: That wall: 
#tr.en: The Link of the Lands 
#tr.en: he named it. 
#tr.en: The people of the land of Sumer 
#tr.en: and Akkad 
#tr.en: peaceful residences

#tr.en: The name of Sîn-muballiț, 
#tr.en: his grandfather, 
#tr.en: throughout the world quarters 
#tr.en: he made famous. 
#tr.en: When Enlil, 
#tr.en: king of the gods, 
#tr.en: great lord 
#tr.en: of the lands, 
#tr.en: at Šamaš with his features 
#tr.en: excellent 
#tr.en: looked, and 
#tr.en: Sippar, 
#tr.en: his ancient cult city, 
#tr.en: to built its wall, 
#tr.en: the Ebabbar to its previous condition 
#tr.en: to return, 
#tr.en: the ziggurrat's high terrace 
#tr.en: lofty 
#tr.en: its top like the heavens 
#tr.en: to raise up, 
#tr.en: Šamaš and Aia 
#tr.en: into their residence 
#tr.en: sacred 
#tr.en: in joy 
#tr.en: and rejoicing to let enter, 
#tr.en: with his utterance which cannot 
#tr.en: be altered 
#tr.en: he commanded, 
#tr.en: at that time, 
#tr.en: the hero, youthful Šamaš - 
#tr.en: for the great destinies 
#tr.en: which Enlil 
#tr.en: for Sippar 
#tr.en: and the Ebabbar had decreed 
#tr.en: joyfylly 
#tr.en: having been established for him - 
#tr.en: Samsu-iluna, 
#tr.en: the king, the creation 
#tr.en: of his hand, me, 
#tr.en: he gladly called, and 
#tr.en: that order 
#tr.en: he gave me. 
#tr.en: At that time, the totality 
#tr.en: of the land of Sumer 
#tr.en: and Akkad, 
#tr.en: which had become hostile to me, 
#tr.en: within 
#tr.en: one year 
#tr.en: eight times 
#tr.en: I indeed slaughtered with weapons. 
#tr.en: The cities of those hostile to me 
#tr.en: into mounds and ruins 
#tr.en: I indeed turned. 
#tr.en: The foundations of the enemies and evil ones 
#tr.en: in the country I tore out. 
#tr.en: The whole country 
#tr.en: under my command 
#tr.en: I made to dwell. 
#tr.en: Since the distant day 
#tr.en: when the brickwork of the Ebabbar 
#tr.en: had been constructed, 
#tr.en: among former kings 
#tr.en: no king 
#tr.en: had been favored by Šamaš and so 
#tr.en: the wall of Sippar 
#tr.en: did not build for him, but 
#tr.en: Samsu-iluna, 
#tr.en: the beloved of Šamaš and Aia, 
#tr.en: the mighty king, 
#tr.en: king of Babylon 
#tr.en: and king of the world quarters 
#tr.en: four, 
#tr.en: the king whose decrees 
#tr.en: with Šamaš and Aia 
#tr.en: find favor, I - 
#tr.en: at the command of Šamaš 
#tr.en: and Marduk 
#tr.en: by a levy 
#tr.en: of the army of my land 
#tr.en: in the middle 
#tr.en: of that year 
#tr.en: its bricks I formed, 
#tr.en: and the wall of Sippar 
#tr.en: like a great mountain 
#tr.en: I raised up. 
#tr.en: The Ebabbar I renovated, 
#tr.en: their ziggurrat's 
#tr.en: high terrace 
#tr.en: exalted 
#tr.en: its top like heaven 
#tr.en: I raised. 
#tr.en: Šamaš, Iškur and Aia 
#tr.en: into their residence 
#tr.en: sacred 
#tr.en: in joy and rejoicing 
#tr.en: I caused to enter. 
#tr.en: To the Ebabbar its guardian genius 
#tr.en: favorable 
#tr.en: I returned. 
#tr.en: That which to Šamaš, 
#tr.en: Iškur, and Aia 
#tr.en: was pleasing I did. 
#tr.en: The command of Šamaš 
#tr.en: and Marduk 
#tr.en: I well executed. 
#tr.en: That wall: Šamaš 
#tr.en: to Samsu-iluna 
#tr.en: Has Given 
#tr.en: Dominion, Power 
#tr.en: and Life is its name. 
#tr.en: For this, Šamaš, 
#tr.en: the one who upholds 
#tr.en: his kingship, 
#tr.en: life, happiness 
#tr.en: of heart 
#tr.en: everlasting, 
#tr.en: a kingship which a rival 
#tr.en: will not have, 
#tr.en: a scepter of justice 
#tr.en: that makes the land secure, 
#tr.en: a strong weapon 
#tr.en: that slays the enemies, 
#tr.en: and rule over the four world 
#tr.en: quarters 
#tr.en: to exercise forever, 
#tr.en: as his gift 
#tr.en: he gave to him. 
#tr.en: The year had not reached the middle, when 
#tr.en: Rīm-Sîn, 
#tr.en: ...
#tr.en: ...
#tr.en: ... 
#tr.en: its parapet ... 
#tr.en: like a mountain range he ..., 
#tr.en: its top he ...,  
#tr.en: and when he had ... its wall, 
#tr.en: then the god ... 
#tr.en: Utu, the king of the gods, 
#tr.en: like the sun he(?) looked at ...
#tr.en: A clay stele ... 
#tr.en: the top he will ... for him. 
#tr.en: When Anum and Enlil, 
#tr.en: the kings of heaven and earth, 
#tr.en: at Marduk, 
#tr.en: the first-born son of Ea, 
#tr.en: looked happily 
#tr.en: and the rule over the four world quarters 
#tr.en: did give to him, 
#tr.en: among the Anunnaku 
#tr.en: did call him by an exalted name, 
#tr.en: (and) Babylon's 
#tr.en: foundation like heaven and earth 
#tr.en: did make secure for him - 
#tr.en: then Marduk 
#tr.en: the Enlil of his land, 
#tr.en: the divine creator of wisdom, 
#tr.en: to Samsu-iluna, 
#tr.en: the king of his delight, me - 
#tr.en: the totality of the lands 
#tr.en: he gave me for shepherding, 
#tr.en: (and) to make his land lie down in riverine meadows 
#tr.en: (and) his wide-spread people 
#tr.en: in well-being 
#tr.en: to lead forever 
#tr.en: he ordered me grandly. 
#tr.en: Samsu-iluna, 
#tr.en: the mighty king, 
#tr.en: king of Babylon, 
#tr.en: the king who makes harmonious 
#tr.en: the world quarters 
#tr.en: the four, I - 
#tr.en: by my own power 
#tr.en: (and) by my great intelligence 
#tr.en: the fort Dimat-Enlil, 
#tr.en: for Ninmah 
#tr.en: the mother who created me, 
#tr.en: the fort Pada 
#tr.en: for Iškur my helper, 
#tr.en: fort Lagaba 
#tr.en: for Sîn the god who created me, 
#tr.en: fort Iri-Iabušum 
#tr.en: for Šar-ṣarbatim 
#tr.en: who magnifies my kingship, 
#tr.en: fort Iri-Gulaba 
#tr.en: and the fort Uṣi-ana-Erra 
#tr.en: for Nergal, 
#tr.en: the smiter of my enemies, 
#tr.en: these six great forts 
#tr.en: which Sūmû-la-Il, 
#tr.en: my great forefather, 
#tr.en: my forefather 
#tr.en: of the fifth (generation), had built, 
#tr.en: (but) which in their old age 
#tr.en: of ther own accord 
#tr.en: had fallen into ruin, 
#tr.en: within two months 
#tr.en: their bricks I had made 
#tr.en: and I rebuilt them in a grand fashion. 
#tr.en: Their tops I raised up like mountains, 
#tr.en: (and so) I secured the foundations of the totality of the lands. 
#tr.en: The name of Babylon 
#tr.en: I made supreme, 
#tr.en: and in the four world quarters 
#tr.en: I indeed made it pre-eminent. 
#tr.en: The fearsomeness of the divine radiance of my kingship 
#tr.en: the borders of heaven and earth 
#tr.en: did indeed cover. 
#tr.en: For this, the great gods 
#tr.en: with their shining faces 
#tr.en: indeed looked at me, 
#tr.en: (and) life, which like that of Sîn 
#tr.en: is monthly 
#tr.en: renewed; 
#tr.en: the shepherding of the four world quarters 
#tr.en: in peace 
#tr.en: to exercise forever; 
#tr.en: the desire of my heart 
#tr.en: to attain, like a god; 
#tr.en: (and) daily with a high head 
#tr.en: in joy 
#tr.en: and happiness 
#tr.en: to walk, 
#tr.en: for a gift 
#tr.en: they did indeed present to me. 
#tr.en: ... fired long tablet 
#tr.en: (which) ... from its top 
#tr.en: he wrote ... 
#tr.en: When An and Enlil, 
#tr.en: the kings of heaven and earth, 
#tr.en: toward Marduk, the first-born son 
#tr.en: of Enki, 
#tr.en: their joyful eyes 
#tr.en: did direct, 
#tr.en: the rule of the four world quarters 
#tr.en: did give to him, 
#tr.en: before the Anunna gods 
#tr.en: his exalted name did call, 
#tr.en: and Babylon's 
#tr.en: foundation, like that of heaven and earth 
#tr.en: did make firm for him - 
#tr.en: then Marduk, 
#tr.en: the Enlil of his land, 
#tr.en: the god who wisdom 
#tr.en: creates, 
#tr.en: to me, Samsu-iluna, 
#tr.en: who is the king his delight, 
#tr.en: of all those lands 
#tr.en: to exercise their shepherding 
#tr.en: he did give me, 
#tr.en: and his country 
#tr.en: to make lie down in riverine meadows, 
#tr.en: and his wide-spread people 
#tr.en: to lead forever in well-being, 
#tr.en: he issued to me (these) great instructions. 
#tr.en: I, Samsu-iluna, 
#tr.en: the mighty king, 
#tr.en: king of Babylon, 
#tr.en: king who among the four world quarters 
#tr.en: established harmony, 
#tr.en: by my own power 
#tr.en: and through my great intelligence, 
#tr.en: the fort Dimat-Enlil 
#tr.en: for Ningursaga 
#tr.en: the mother who created me, 
#tr.en: the fort Pada 
#tr.en: for Iškur my helper, 
#tr.en: the fort Lagaba 
#tr.en: for Nanna 
#tr.en: the god who goes at my head, 
#tr.en: the fort Iri-Iabušum 
#tr.en: for Šar-ṣarbatim 
#tr.en: because my kingship 
#tr.en: he had made very great, 
#tr.en: the fort Iri-Gulaba 
#tr.en: and the fort Uṣi-ana-Erra 
#tr.en: for Nergal 
#tr.en: because the smiting of my foes 
#tr.en: he did accomplish, 
#tr.en: these six great fortressess 
#tr.en: which Sūmû-la-Il, 
#tr.en: my forefather 
#tr.en: my fifth(-generation) ancestor, 
#tr.en: did build, 
#tr.en: but which in their old age by themselves 
#tr.en: did collapse, 
#tr.en: within two months 
#tr.en: their bricks I had made, 
#tr.en: and I rebuilt them in a grand fashion. 
#tr.en: Their tops I raised up like mountains, 
#tr.en: (and thus) of the whole of the lands 
#tr.en: their foundations I made secure. 
#tr.en: Babylon's 
#tr.en: name I made supreme, 
#tr.en: and within the four world quarters I truly made it pre-eminent. 
#tr.en: The fearsomeness of the divine radiance 
#tr.en: of my kingship 
#tr.en: truly covered the edges of heaven and earth. 
#tr.en: For this, 
#tr.en: the great gods 
#tr.en: their shining faces 
#tr.en: they directed towards me, 
#tr.en: and life, which like (the moon-god) Nanna 
#tr.en: waxes month after month, 
#tr.en: shepherdship of the four world quarters 
#tr.en: to exercise in well-being forever, 
#tr.en: the desire of my heart 
#tr.en: to attain like a god, 
#tr.en: (and) daily with an uplifted head 
#tr.en: to walk in joy and happiness 
#tr.en: they presented to me as a gift. 
#tr.en: Samsu-iluna,

#tr.en: king 
#tr.en: of Babylon, 
#tr.en: king 
#tr.en: of Kiš,

#tr.en: and Inanna 
#tr.en: in Kiš
#tr.en: he renovated, 
#tr.en: and its top (as high) as the sky 
#tr.en: he raised up there. 
#tr.en: Enlil, whose lordship 
#tr.en: is the greatest among the gods, 
#tr.en: the shepherd who determines the destinies, 
#tr.en: Zababa and Ištar, 
#tr.en: the warriors among the Igigi gods, 
#tr.en: with his pure face 
#tr.en: he regarded them, and 
#tr.en: the city Kiš, the foremost cult site, 
#tr.en: their exalted residence, 
#tr.en: to built its wall, 
#tr.en: and its top more than before 
#tr.en: to raise up, 
#tr.en: his heart truly moved him. 
#tr.en: And Enlil, the great lord, 
#tr.en: whose utterance 
#tr.en: cannot be overturned - 
#tr.en: the destiny which he determines 
#tr.en: cannot be altered - 
#tr.en: at Zababa his heir, 
#tr.en: the mighty, 
#tr.en: who achieves his victories, 
#tr.en: (and) Inanna, the daughter 
#tr.en: whom he loves, 
#tr.en: the lady whose divinity 
#tr.en: is unrivaled, 
#tr.en: with his face of happiness 
#tr.en: he regarded them, and 
#tr.en: words of heart-felt happiness 
#tr.en: he spoke with them:

#tr.en: The city Kiš, our awe-inspiring cult site, 
#tr.en: built its wall! 
#tr.en: More than before 
#tr.en: make it greater! 
#tr.en: Samsu-iluna, 
#tr.en: the capable king, 
#tr.en: one who heeds the great gods, 
#tr.en: the word which Zababa 
#tr.en: and Ištar had spoken to him 
#tr.en: he trusted completely, and 
#tr.en: his weaponry 
#tr.en: for the killing of his enemies 
#tr.en: he prepared. 
#tr.en: On a campaign to slay 
#tr.en: his enemies 
#tr.en: he set forth. 
#tr.en: The year was not half over 
#tr.en: when Rīm-Sîn, 
#tr.en: who had caused to rebel 
#tr.en: Emutbala, 
#tr.en: (and) who to the kingship of Larsa 
#tr.en: had been elevated, 
#tr.en: he slew, and 
#tr.en: in the territory of Kiš 
#tr.en: he heaped up a burial mound over him. 
#tr.en: Twenty-six rebel kings, 
#tr.en: his foes, he slew; 
#tr.en: he slaughtered them all. 
#tr.en: Iluni, the king of Ešnunna, 
#tr.en: who did not heed his words, 
#tr.en: he defeated, 
#tr.en: in a neck-stock 
#tr.en: he led him away, and 
#tr.en: his life 
#tr.en: he devoured. 
#tr.en: The totality of the country of Sumer and Akkad 
#tr.en: he caused to be of one mind. 
#tr.en: The four world quarters 
#tr.en: under his command 
#tr.en: he caused to dwell. 
#tr.en: At that time, 
#tr.en: Samsu-iluna, the mighty, 
#tr.en: through the strength of his army 
#tr.en: built the city of Kiš. 
#tr.en: He dug its canal, 
#tr.en: surrounded it with a reed marsh, 
#tr.en: (and) with much earth 
#tr.en: made its foundations as firm as a mountain. 
#tr.en: He had the bricks for it formed 
#tr.en: and built its wall. 
#tr.en: Within one year its top 
#tr.en: he raised up more than before. 
#tr.en: For this, 
#tr.en: Zababa and Ištar 
#tr.en: to Samsu-iluna,

#tr.en: well-being and life,

#tr.en: for a gift 
#tr.en: may they bestow upon him, 
#tr.en: and as a present 
#tr.en: may they present to him. 
#tr.en: Enlil, whose kingship
#tr.en: of all the gods 
#tr.en: is the greatest, 
#tr.en: the shepherd who determines the destinies, 
#tr.en: because Zababa and Inanna 
#tr.en: among the great (divine) princes
#tr.en: were the most heroic, 
#tr.en: he looked at them with his holy eyes. 
#tr.en: The city Kiš,  
#tr.en: their foremost cult site 
#tr.en: and exalted residence, 
#tr.en: to build its wall 
#tr.en: and to raise up its top more than before 
#tr.en: his heart truly moved him. 
#tr.en: And Enlil, the great lord,  
#tr.en: whose utterance cannot be overturned  
#tr.en: and a fate which he determines 
#tr.en: cannot be altered, 
#tr.en: To him (Zababa) who his victories
#tr.en: achieves, 
#tr.en: and Inanna, the daughter 
#tr.en: whom he loves, 
#tr.en: the lady whose divinity 
#tr.en: is unrivaled, 
#tr.en: his joyful eyes he directed towards them, and
#tr.en: words of heart-felt happiness 
#tr.en: he spoke with them. 
#tr.en: Samsu-iluna, 
#tr.en: my envoy, mighty 
#tr.en: and untiring, 
#tr.en: who the desire of my heart 
#tr.en: knows how to put in place, 
#tr.en: may you both be his shining light.
#tr.en: (Zababa and Ištar) the most majestic of the gods, 
#tr.en: at the words that their father Enlil 
#tr.en: had spoken to them, 
#tr.en: their hearts rejoiced full of delight.
#tr.en: To Samsu-iluna, 
#tr.en: the mighty king, the shepherd and hero, 
#tr.en: their accomplishment, 
#tr.en: their countenances of life 
#tr.en: they lifted shiningly towards him,   
#tr.en: and joyfully they conversed with him. 
#tr.en: O Samsu-iluna, 
#tr.en: eternal seed of kingship, 
#tr.en: one fitting for kingship, 
#tr.en: Enlil 
#tr.en: has magnified your destiny. 
#tr.en: To act with well-being as (your) guardian genies 
#tr.en: he has commanded us. 
#tr.en: When we shall have gone at your right side
#tr.en: the persons who hate you 
#tr.en: we shall smite, 
#tr.en: and your foes 
#tr.en: we shall put into your hands. 
#tr.en: The city Kiš, our [awe-inpiring] cult site, 
#tr.en: build its wall! 
#tr.en: Make it greater than what was there before!
#tr.en: Samsu-iluna, 
#tr.en: Iluni, the king of Ešnunna, 
#tr.en: who did not heed his words, 
#tr.en: he held onto. 
#tr.en: With his neck held in a neck-stock  
#tr.en: he brought him in, 
#tr.en: and his life he slew with a knife. 
#tr.en: All of Sumer and Akkad
#tr.en: he caused to be of one mind.
#tr.en: The four world quarters 
#tr.en: under his command he caused to dwell. 
#tr.en: At that time, Samsu-iluna, the mighty man, 
#tr.en: through the strength of his army, 
#tr.en: rebuilt the the city Kiš. 
#tr.en: He dug its canal, 
#tr.en: and with much earth its foundation
#tr.en: (Samsu-iluna, the first-born son) of Hammurapi,  
#tr.en: the ruler who broadened the land, 
#tr.en: the king who the land 
#tr.en: of Idamaraz 
#tr.en: from the border of Gutium

#tr.en: with his mighty weapon 
#tr.en: did subjugate, 
#tr.en: (and) he gathered up and
#tr.en: to their places 
#tr.en: he returned (its scattered people). 
#tr.en: At that time, 
#tr.en: Samsu-iluna the mighty, 
#tr.en: in order to let the people living 
#tr.en: on the banks of the Turul 
#tr.en: and Țaban rivers
#tr.en: in peaceful residences 
#tr.en: be caused to dwell, 
#tr.en: that one who terrified (them) 
#tr.en: Samsu-iluna, 
#tr.en: the mighty king, 
#tr.en: king of Babylon, 
#tr.en: king of Kiš, 
#tr.en: king who makes the four world quarters 
#tr.en: of one mind, 
#tr.en: the king who, at the order 
#tr.en: of An and Enlil, 
#tr.en: all those who hated him 
#tr.en: a smashing 
#tr.en: delivered, 
#tr.en: the shepherd for whom Inanna 
#tr.en: her favorable omen 
#tr.en: and assistance 
#tr.en: performed, 
#tr.en: the man who of those who turned away from him in their ... 
#tr.en: bound their hands, 
#tr.en: one who evil-doers 
#tr.en: made disappear from the country, 
#tr.en: who a shining light among the numerous people 
#tr.en: made come forth, 
#tr.en: foremost heir 
#tr.en: of Hammurapi 
#tr.en: the ruler who broadened the country, 
#tr.en: the king who the land 
#tr.en: of Idamaraz 
#tr.en: from the border of Gutium 
#tr.en: to the border of Elam 
#tr.en: with his mighty weapon 
#tr.en: did completely subjugate, 
#tr.en: and the wide-spread people of the land 
#tr.en: of Idamaraz 
#tr.en: did conquer, 
#tr.en: who all of the various fortresses 
#tr.en: of the land of Warûm 
#tr.en: which had acted hostile to him	 
#tr.en: did strike with pickaxes, 
#tr.en: and who his victories 
#tr.en: did so achieve 
#tr.en: and his force of arms 
#tr.en: did make brilliantly apparent - 
#tr.en: When two months had passed, 
#tr.en: the people of the land of Idamaraz 
#tr.en: which he had treated as booty, 
#tr.en: and the troops of Ešnunna 
#tr.en: as many as he had taken as captives, 
#tr.en: having set them free 
#tr.en: and a life-giving hand

#tr.en: having rebuilt, 
#tr.en: and their scattered people 
#tr.en: having gathered up again 
#tr.en: and returned to their places, 
#tr.en: then Samsu-iluna, the mighty man, 
#tr.en: that the people who on the banks of the Durul 
#tr.en: and the Țaban rivers 
#tr.en: were dwelling 
#tr.en: could live in peaceful residences, 
#tr.en: that they may have no persons terrifying them, 
#tr.en: and that the mighty force

#tr.en: formed the bricks for it, 
#tr.en: and built that fortress there.

#tr.en: who opens canals, 
#tr.en: who builds walls, 
#tr.en: who erects stelas bearing (his) name,  
#tr.en: who establishes abundance 
#tr.en: and plenty for his people,  
#tr.en: who produces every sort of things  
#tr.en: in his land, 
#tr.en: the mighty king and splendid youth - 
#tr.en: when Šamaš to his petitions
#tr.en: did agree, 
#tr.en: and listened to what he said,  
#tr.en: Šamaš to Iaḫdun-Līm
#tr.en: hastened  
#tr.en: to walk at his side.
#tr.en: Since olden times 
#tr.en: when the God built Mari,  
#tr.en: no king residing in Mari 
#tr.en: had reached the sea, 
#tr.en: nor the mountains of cedar and boxwood, 
#tr.en: the great mountains, had he ever reached  
#tr.en: and cut down their trees. 
#tr.en: (But) Iaḫdun-Līm, 
#tr.en: the son of Iaggid-Līm, 
#tr.en: the powerful king, a wild bull of kings, 
#tr.en: by his own power 
#tr.en: and overwhelming strength
#tr.en: to the shore of the sea 
#tr.en: he went, and 
#tr.en: to the sea an offering for his kingship, 
#tr.en: a big one, he offered,  
#tr.en: and his troops in the sea  
#tr.en: washed themselves with water. 
#tr.en: (Then) into the mountains of cedat and boxwood,  
#tr.en: the great mountains, he entered, and 
#tr.en: boxwood, cedar, cypress, 
#tr.en: and elammaku, 
#tr.en: these trees he cut down. 
#tr.en: He made a commemorative monument (RIME), 
#tr.en: established his name, 
#tr.en: and made his power known. 
#tr.en: That land on the shore of the sea 
#tr.en: he made submit, 
#tr.en: caused it to live subject to (his) decree, 
#tr.en: and made it follow after him. 
#tr.en: A permanent tribute 
#tr.en: he imposed upon them, 
#tr.en: and their tribute is still being brought to him.
#tr.en: In that same year, 
#tr.en: La'um, king of Samānum 
#tr.en: and the land of the Ubrabium, 
#tr.en: Baḫlukullim, king of Tuttul 
#tr.en: and the land of the Amnānum, 
#tr.en: Aiālum, king of Abattum 
#tr.en: and of the land of the Rabbum - 
#tr.en: these kings 
#tr.en: rebelled against him, 
#tr.en: and to their assistance    
#tr.en: the troops of Sūmû-Epuḫ
#tr.en: of the land of Iamḫad  
#tr.en: came, and
#tr.en: in the city of Samānum 
#tr.en: the main contingent of Mār Mîm
#tr.en: gathered together against him, and
#tr.en: with heavy weaponry  
#tr.en: these three kings 
#tr.en: of Mār Mîm he defeated. 
#tr.en: Their troops and their auxiliary troops he slew.  
#tr.en: He inflicted a defeat upon them 
#tr.en: and piled up their corpses.
#tr.en: Their walls he broke down, and 
#tr.en: into ruined mounds and ruin heaps 
#tr.en: he made them. 
#tr.en: The city of Haman of the main contingent of Hana, 
#tr.en: which all the elders of Hana had built,  
#tr.en: he destroyed, and 
#tr.en: to ruin mounds and ruin heaps he made them. 
#tr.en: Further, he defeated their king Kaşuri-Hāla.
#tr.en: He deported their population and 
#tr.en: took control of the banks of the Euphrates.  
#tr.en: For his own life, the temple of Šamaš his lord, 
#tr.en: a temple whose construction was perfect and
#tr.en: completed with masterly craftsmanship, 
#tr.en: a thing befitting his divinity, he built for him. 
#tr.en: In his majestic residence 
#tr.en: he settled him. The name of that temple 
#tr.en: he called: Egirizalanki 
#tr.en: (that is) Temple - Delight of Heaven  
#tr.en: and Earth.
#tr.en: Šamaš, who resides in that temple, 
#tr.en: to Iaḫdun-Līm the builder of his temple, 
#tr.en: the king beloved of his heart, 
#tr.en: a mighty weapon 
#tr.en: which conquers the foe, 
#tr.en: a long reign 
#tr.en: of happiness, 
#tr.en: and years of joyous abundance, 
#tr.en: forever,  
#tr.en: may he grant to him.
#tr.en: (But) the one who that temple 
#tr.en: shall destroy, 
#tr.en: to evil 
#tr.en: and no good shall ... to it,  
#tr.en: who does not strengthen its foundation, 
#tr.en: who does not erect again what has fallen down, 
#tr.en: or who the regular offering meals 
#tr.en: shall cut off from it, 
#tr.en: who shall efface my inscription  
#tr.en: or shall cause it to be effaced   
#tr.en: (and) shall write his own name which had not been written there, 
#tr.en: or shall cause it to be written,
#tr.en: or because of the curse 
#tr.en: shall procure another (to do it) -  
#tr.en: that man, whether he be a king,  
#tr.en: or a viceroy, 
#tr.en: or a mayor, 
#tr.en: or just a common man, 
#tr.en: that man  
#tr.en: may Enlil, the judge of the gods, 
#tr.en: make his rule the shortest  
#tr.en: among all kings. 
#tr.en: May Sîn, the eldest brother 
#tr.en: among the gods his brothers 
#tr.en: curse him with a great 
#tr.en: curse. 
#tr.en: May Nergal, the lord of weapons, 
#tr.en: break his weapon, so that
#tr.en: he cannot withstand warriors(?). 
#tr.en: May Ea, the king of destiny, 
#tr.en: determine for him an evil destiny. 
#tr.en: May the daughter-in-law Aia, 
#tr.en: the great lady, 
#tr.en: speak badly of him 
#tr.en: before Šamaš forever. 
#tr.en: May Bunene the cheif vizier of Šamaš 
#tr.en: cut his throat. 
#tr.en: May he pluck up his seed, and 
#tr.en: may his offspring and progeny 
#tr.en:: not walk in the presence of Šamaš. 
#tr.en: Iasmaḫ-Addu, 
#tr.en: appointed by Enlil,  
#tr.en: son of Šamšī-Adad, 
#tr.en: for Šamaš 
#tr.en: his lord, 
#tr.en: Within 
#tr.en: the city of Mari,  
#tr.en: which he loves, 
#tr.en: he had it (this statue) fabricated 
#tr.en: and dedicated (it). 
#tr.en: He who my inscribed 
#tr.en: name 
#tr.en: shall remove and 
#tr.en: shall have his own name inscribed, 
#tr.en: may Šamaš my lord 
#tr.en: his foundation 
#tr.en: tear out, 
#tr.en: and his seed 
#tr.en: may he pluck up.
#tr.en: To Ištar, queen of heaven and earth, 
#tr.en: who resides in the Ešabanna temple, 
#tr.en: she who listens to prayers, his mistress,  
#tr.en: Iasmaḫ-Addu,  
#tr.en: son of Šamšī-Adad, 
#tr.en: made a (vow) dedication to her.
#tr.en: Two silver gifts(?) 
#tr.en: that by the craftsmen 
#tr.en: were perfectly fashioned 
#tr.en: he dedicated.

#tr.en: prayers, who dwells

#tr.en: her mistress, 
#tr.en: Izamu, the kezertum priestess, 
#tr.en: who well executes  
#tr.en: the Raised Hand prayers of her lord  
#tr.en: Iasmaḫ-Addu - 
#tr.en: when my lady Eštar 
#tr.en: my prayer 
#tr.en: did hear, 
#tr.en: and my petition  
#tr.en: did accept, 
#tr.en: her statue 
#tr.en: I dedicated to her. 
#tr.en: A statue which by 
#tr.en: the craftsmen 
#tr.en: was made perfectly 
#tr.en: I dedicated to her.

#tr.en: four  
#tr.en: became hostile to me, 
#tr.en: for eight 
#tr.en: years 
#tr.en: battle 
#tr.en: I waged, and 
#tr.en: in the eighth 
#tr.en: year 
#tr.en: my opponent 
#tr.en: to clay 
#tr.en: indeed turned. 
#tr.en: My army 
#tr.en: into three 
#tr.en: hundred (men) 
#tr.en: was turned. 
#tr.en: When

#tr.en: to my assistance 
#tr.en: came, then 
#tr.en: some food to eat 
#tr.en: I took, and 
#tr.en: on a campaign 
#tr.en: for one day 
#tr.en: I went. 
#tr.en: So for forty days

#tr.en: At that harvest time

#tr.en: Ipiq-Eštar, king 
#tr.en: appointed by Enki and Damkina,  
#tr.en: king of Malgium, 
#tr.en: son of Apil-ilīšu - 
#tr.en: when Anum, Enlil, Bēlet-ilī, 
#tr.en: and Ea, my king, 
#tr.en: had taken counsel about the land, 
#tr.en: he who dwells in the apsû(?), the lord of every secret, 
#tr.en: made it known to his wife, 
#tr.en: the pure Damkina, 
#tr.en: (saying) Quickly! Take away the offence! 
#tr.en: Avert misfortune! 
#tr.en: Into the future  
#tr.en: may its foundation be secure, 
#tr.en: that of Malgium, your city! 
#tr.en: May the kingship and rule last long, 
#tr.en: may it never cease in the Temple of Life!
#tr.en: At that time, the land came down 
#tr.en: in its entirety, all of it; 
#tr.en: it set up a great clamor  
#tr.en: and caused trouble. 
#tr.en: It desecrated the sanctuary, 
#tr.en: the residence of great Bēlet-ilī, 
#tr.en: and cut down the awe-inspiring protection, her grove.  
#tr.en: Ipiq-Eštar, the pious king, 
#tr.en: the creation of his hand, 
#tr.en: of Ea, namely I - 
#tr.en: from the very first, Ea and Damkina 
#tr.en: desired that I serve them;  
#tr.en: I made and built the house 
#tr.en: for Bēlet-ilī my mother. 
#tr.en: I planted for her a sacred garden, 
#tr.en: one befitting her divinity.
#tr.en: I set up regular offerings of fruit 
#tr.en: before her, forever. 
#tr.en: I named the house Temple - Residence of Intelligence.
#tr.en: I returned to her (her) former dais 
#tr.en: and founded well her residence. 
#tr.en: Whoever shall remove my foundation documents, 
#tr.en: with a great curse may Bēlet-ilī  
#tr.en:: curse him!
#tr.en: Takil-ilissu, 
#tr.en: the mighty king, 
#tr.en: king of Malgium, 
#tr.en: son of Ištaran-asu - 
#tr.en: when Ea 
#tr.en: and Damkina 
#tr.en: to the shepherdship of Malgium 
#tr.en: called me by name, 
#tr.en: (and) my lord Ea 
#tr.en: with his sacred mouth  
#tr.en: spoke to me, 
#tr.en: at that time, the Enamtila temple, 
#tr.en: its entire outside 
#tr.en: with a great supporting wall 
#tr.en: of baked bricks,  
#tr.en: of which, like heaven,  
#tr.en: the foundation was firm, 
#tr.en: I surrounded. 
#tr.en: (Thus) the eternal name 
#tr.en: of my kingship 
#tr.en: I did indeed establish. 
#tr.en: The one who my inscribed name 
#tr.en: shall erase and 
#tr.en: shall write his own name (on it), 
#tr.en: may he quickly be removed, and 
#tr.en: may his inscribed name 
#tr.en: not be restored.  
#tr.en: That person, whether a king or a lord, a gudu priest, 
#tr.en: or one who among humanity  
#tr.en: may be called by a name, 
#tr.en: may Ea and Damkina 
#tr.en: tear out his foundation 
#tr.en: and pluck up his seed. 
#tr.en: May Usmû, the chief minister of Ea, 
#tr.en: be his evil demon,  
#tr.en: unalterably, 
#tr.en: forever. 
#tr.en: Takil-ilissu, 
#tr.en: the mighty king, 
#tr.en: king of Malgium, 
#tr.en: son of Ištaran-asu -

#tr.en: called me by name, 
#tr.en: for great Anum, 
#tr.en: who keeps secure the throne 
#tr.en: of my kingship, his temple 
#tr.en: which over many years had fallen into disrepair, 
#tr.en: I inspected and renovated. 
#tr.en: An  ... offering meal,   
#tr.en: his sacred food,  
#tr.en: and  his praised(?) water, 
#tr.en: on the day of the new moon and the 15th day  
#tr.en: I established for him on a continual basis. 
#tr.en: Also for Ninšubur, 
#tr.en: a portion for his office of chief minister
#tr.en: from the offering meal 
#tr.en: of great Anum,  
#tr.en: endlessly,  
#tr.en: I indeed had set up for him. 
#tr.en: For Ulmaššītum, 
#tr.en: she who called my name, 
#tr.en: the Emaš temple, the seat of her veil, 
#tr.en: the great courtyard, 
#tr.en: home of the numerous people, 
#tr.en: his temple of exultation and courtyard of joy  
#tr.en: where she and Ninšubur 
#tr.en: the joys of abundance 
#tr.en: and festivals of happiness of heart 
#tr.en: therein 
#tr.en: do regularly celebrate. 
#tr.en: With a great terrace 
#tr.en: its foundations in/with ...
#tr.en: I did ... 
#tr.en: frontings(?) of baked brick 
#tr.en: ... a courtyard 
#tr.en: befitting her divinity 
#tr.en: and youthfulness.  
#tr.en: Dãn-bītim and Rašub-bītim,
#tr.en: the lions her envoys, 
#tr.en: they who go at her side 
#tr.en: at the place of royal libations 
#tr.en: and burning-flour offerings of the numerous people, 
#tr.en: I did indeed install. 
#tr.en: I inspected the temple, and its routines 
#tr.en: I put in order.
#tr.en: Holy sasqû offering-flour,  
#tr.en: a kulmašītu priestess, 
#tr.en: two hundred female tigū-instrument players,  
#tr.en: great music -  
#tr.en: an appropriate clangor -   
#tr.en: which for her great divinity 
#tr.en: was suitable, 
#tr.en: in that temple I did indeed set in place. 
#tr.en: Whoever removes my foundation document 
#tr.en: (or) my inscribed name 
#tr.en: makes disappear 
#tr.en: (and) writes his name (on it) 
#tr.en: let him examine the temple(?), 
#tr.en: renew the ... 
#tr.en: (and) build up the terrace. 
#tr.en: He who the name of king Takil-ilissu  
#tr.en: does not restore to its place,

#tr.en: or a governor, a gudu priest,  
#tr.en: or any one among humanity 
#tr.en: called by name, 
#tr.en: may Anum, king of the great gods, 
#tr.en: look with disfavor and his kingship's 
#tr.en: foundation tear out. 
#tr.en: and may his kinghip in wailing 
#tr.en: be ended.
#tr.en: May Annunītum, 
#tr.en: who loves my reign, 
#tr.en: destroy him, 
#tr.en: and a great pain 
#tr.en: put in his body, 
#tr.en: a punishment which has never before existed 
#tr.en: among the people. 
#tr.en: May Ulmašītum, 
#tr.en: who called my name, 
#tr.en: the advising of his obliteration,   
#tr.en: the verdict of non-life for him 
#tr.en: forever, may she speak.
#tr.en: May Ninšubur, the vizier of Anum, 
#tr.en: his forehead 
#tr.en: strike, and 
#tr.en: confuse his mind. 
#tr.en: May Dãn-bītim and Rašub-bītim

#tr.en: When Enlil, 
#tr.en: the king of the gods, 
#tr.en: the great lord of all the lands, 
#tr.en: towards Utu his gracious eyes 
#tr.en: did direct, 
#tr.en: and of Sippar, 
#tr.en: his ancient city and cult site, 
#tr.en: its wall to build, 
#tr.en: the Ebabbar temple 
#tr.en: to restore, 
#tr.en: of his ziggurrat and lofty high terrace 
#tr.en: its top to raise as high as the sky, 
#tr.en: and Utu and (his consort) Šerda 
#tr.en: into their sacred residence 
#tr.en: to introduce amidst very happy rejoicing, 
#tr.en: with his word which cannot be altered 
#tr.en: he spoke to him - 
#tr.en: At that time, 
#tr.en: for the hero, youthful Utu, 
#tr.en: a great destiny that by Enlil 
#tr.en: regarding Sippar and the Ebabbar temple 
#tr.en: had been decreed 
#tr.en: happily 
#tr.en: was set in place for him. 
#tr.en: To me, Samsu-iluna, 
#tr.en: the king created by him, 
#tr.en: he spoke happily, 
#tr.en: and he issued to me the order for it. 
#tr.en: At that time, 
#tr.en: all of Sumer and Akkad 
#tr.en: whose people had become hostile to me, 
#tr.en: within one year 
#tr.en: eight times 
#tr.en: I struck them with weapons. 
#tr.en: The various cities of my enemies

#tr.en: The enemies 
#tr.en: and evil-doers 
#tr.en: I tore out from the country their foundations, 
#tr.en: and the whole land 
#tr.en: I made dwell under my command. 
#tr.en: From the time long ago 
#tr.en: when the brickwork of the Ebabbar temple 
#tr.en: had been constructed, 
#tr.en: among the kings who had gone before 
#tr.en: no king 
#tr.en: had been favored by Utu 
#tr.en: and so the wall of Sippar 
#tr.en: he had not built. 
#tr.en: (But) I, Samsu-iluna, 
#tr.en: one loved by Utu 
#tr.en: and Šerda, 
#tr.en: the mighty king, 
#tr.en: king of Babylon, 
#tr.en: king of the four world quarters, 
#tr.en: the king whose utterances 
#tr.en: with Utu 
#tr.en: and Šerda have found favor, 
#tr.en: at the commands of Utu 
#tr.en: and Marduk, 
#tr.en: through an army levy 
#tr.en: of my land 
#tr.en: in the middle of that year 
#tr.en: its bricks for it I had formed, 
#tr.en: and the wall of Sippar 
#tr.en: I raised up like a great mountain. 
#tr.en: I renovated the Ebabbar, 
#tr.en: their exalted high terrace of the ziggurrat 
#tr.en: I raised up its top like the sky, 
#tr.en: and Utu, Iškur 
#tr.en: and Šerda 
#tr.en: into their sacred residence 
#tr.en: amidst very happy rejoicing 
#tr.en: I introduced. 
#tr.en: To the Ebabbar 
#tr.en: I returned its favorable guardian genius. 
#tr.en: That which to the welfare of Utu, Iškur, 
#tr.en: and Šerda 
#tr.en: was pleasing I did, 
#tr.en: and that commanded by Utu 
#tr.en: and Marduk 
#tr.en: I put in place. 
#tr.en: Of that wall: Utu 
#tr.en: to Samsu-iluna 
#tr.en: Authority, Might, 
#tr.en: and Life 
#tr.en: Has Presented as a Gift 
#tr.en: is its name. 
#tr.en: Because of this, Utu, 
#tr.en: who his throne 
#tr.en: has therefore supported, 
#tr.en: life, an enduring happy heart, 
#tr.en: kingship which has no rival, 
#tr.en: a scepter of justice 
#tr.en: that keeps the country secure, 
#tr.en: a mighty weapon which pounds the foreigners, 
#tr.en: and rule over the four world quarters 
#tr.en: to exercise forever, as his gifts he gave to him.

#tr.en: and also that which gladdens the heart of Ninlil, 
#tr.en: the king cares unceasingly for the lapis lazuli shrine. 
#tr.en: At that time, Išme-Dagan, a copper statue which inspires fear as it races against the storm, 
#tr.en: in the temple clad in fearsomeness, upon his most precious dais, 
#tr.en: he set it up and colored it brilliantly. 
#tr.en: The great prince of the whole heaven, the lord whose utterance cannot be altered, 
#tr.en: his shining brow and raised righteous eyes 
#tr.en: may he let be upon him, directed towards the faithful shepherd whom he has engendered. 
#tr.en: But a king who orders a wicked thing, 
#tr.en: and erases this inscription and writes his own name upon it, 
#tr.en: or because of this curse incites another person to do it, 
#tr.en: may Enlil my master and Ninli my mistress curse that person. 
#tr.en: May Enki, Iškur, Ezinu, and Šakan, the lords of abundance, 
#tr.en: after locking up abundance in heaven and earth, ... him evilly.

#tr.en: the Nippur shrine Duranki's 
#tr.en: ritual lustrations to cleanse, 
#tr.en: to make the divine rites that had fallen away 
#tr.en: reappear magnificently,
#tr.en: and Nippur, the bellwether of the nation,
#tr.en: to restore to its previous state,
#tr.en: it was Ur-Ninurta,
#tr.en: the one serving the Ekur,
#tr.en: upon whom Enlil, the king of all the lands,
#tr.en: out over the broad population
#tr.en: did lift his eye
#tr.en: and did rightly choose.
#tr.en: (for) An, Enlil, (and) Ninlil
#tr.en: I removed evil,
#tr.en: and (in) the shining Ekur temple in the city ... 
#tr.en: I set them up for them.
#tr.en: (Further,) copper figures whose bodily features  
#tr.en: were made to resemble me, 
#tr.en: with an offering kid,
#tr.en: were made in miniature(?), 
#tr.en: and, set up for (the delivering of) my prayers, 
#tr.en: as the main courtyard of the Gagiššua's  
#tr.en: ornament, I fashioned for her (Ninlil), 
#tr.en: and for my life
#tr.en: I dedicated them to her.
#tr.en: A person who an order of wickedness  
#tr.en: shall issue against it,
#tr.en: and my creation 
#tr.en: shall efface,
#tr.en: by the exalted command of Enlil
#tr.en: ... may his revealed name   
#tr.en: be revoked from within the Ekur.
#tr.en: May Ninurta, the mighty warrior of Enlil, 
#tr.en: be the inseparable bailiff for this
#tr.en: for an eternity of days!
#tr.en: To Enlil, the king of all the lands, 
#tr.en: his master, 
#tr.en: Enlil-bāni,
#tr.en: the mighty king, king of Isin 
#tr.en: and king of Sumer and Akkad,

#tr.en: a thing ...
#tr.en: For Ninlil, 
#tr.en: queen of the gods, 
#tr.en: king Iddin-Dagān  
#tr.en: fashioned two big copper statues 
#tr.en: but did not bring them to Nippur. 
#tr.en: From (the hands of) Iddin-Dagān 
#tr.en: until king Enlil-bāni 
#tr.en: it was 117 years 
#tr.en: that they stood in Isin. 
#tr.en: Ninlil, with a happy heart 
#tr.en: desired it and gave command, and so  
#tr.en: Enlil-bāni, the strong king, 
#tr.en: king of Isin, king of Sumer and Akkad, 
#tr.en: beloved of Enlil and Ninlil, 
#tr.en: those two big copper statues 
#tr.en: from within Isin 
#tr.en: to Nippur he had brought. 
#tr.en: In the great courtyard of the Gageššua temple 
#tr.en: before Ninlil his mistress he set them up. 
#tr.en: Because of this, Ninlil 
#tr.en: the life of Enlil-bāni, 
#tr.en: from (her) place (beside) Enlil, she lengthened its days. 
#tr.en: A person who shall erase this inscription,

#tr.en: Holy Inanna says to Ninšubur: 
#tr.en: “Come my faithful minister of Eanna, 
#tr.en: my minister who speaks fair words, 
#tr.en: my escort who speaks trustworthy words 
#tr.en: “On this day I will descend to the underworld. 
#tr.en: When I have arrived in the underworld,

#tr.en: Make the rounds of the houses of the gods for me. 
#tr.en: “Lacerate your eyes for me, lacerate your nose for me. 
#tr.en: In private, lacerate your buttocks for me. 
#tr.en: Like a pauper, clothe yourself in a single garment 
#tr.en: and all alone set your foot in the E-kur, the house of Enlil. 
#tr.en: “When you have entered the E-kur, the house of Enlil, 
#tr.en: lament before Enlil: 
#tr.en: “Father Enlil, don’t let anyone kill your daughter in the underworld. 
#tr.en: Don’t let your precious metal be alloyed there with the dirt of the underworld. 
#tr.en: Don’t let your precious lapis lazuli be split there with the mason’s stone. 
#tr.en: Don’t let your boxwood be chopped up there with the carpenter’s wood. 
#tr.en: Don’t let young lady Inanna be killed in the underworld.” 
#tr.en: “If Enlil does not help you in this matter, go to Ur. 
#tr.en: In the E-mukura at Ur, 
#tr.en: when you have entered the E-kišnugal toward Nanna, 
#tr.en: lament before Nanna: 
#tr.en: “Father Nanna, don’t let anyone kill your daughter in the underworld. 
#tr.en: Don’t let your precious metal be alloyed there with the dirt of the underworld. 
#tr.en: Don’t let your precious lapis lazuli be split there with the mason’s stone. 
#tr.en: Don’t let your boxwood be chopped up there with the carpenter’s wood. 
#tr.en: Don’t let young lady Inanna be killed in the underworld.” 
#tr.en: “And if Nanna does not help you in this matter, go to Eridu. 
#tr.en: In Eridu, when you have entered the house of Enki, 
#tr.en: lament before Enki: 
#tr.en: “Father Enki, don’t let anyone kill your daughter in the underworld. 
#tr.en: Don’t let your precious metal be alloyed there with the dirt of the underworld. 
#tr.en: Don’t let your precious lapis lazuli be split there with the mason’s stone.

#tr.en: He is the one who will restore me to life.” 
#tr.en: When Inanna traveled on towards the underworld, 
#tr.en: her minister Ninšubur traveled on behind her. 
#tr.en: She says to her minister Ninšubur: 
#tr.en: “Go now, my Ninšubur, and pay attention. 
#tr.en: Don’t neglect the instructions I gave you.” 
#tr.en: When Inanna arrived at the palace Ganzer, 
#tr.en: she pushed aggressively on the door of the underworld. 
#tr.en: She shouted aggressively at the gate of the underworld: 
#tr.en: “Open up, doorman, open up. 
#tr.en: Open up, Neti, open up. I am all alone and I want to come in.” 
#tr.en: Neti, the chief doorman of the underworld, 
#tr.en: answers holy Inanna: 
#tr.en: “Who are you?” 
#tr.en: “I am Inanna going to the east.” 
#tr.en: “If you are Inanna going to the east, 
#tr.en: why have you traveled to the land of no return? 
#tr.en: How did you set your heart on the road whose traveller never returns?” 
#tr.en: Holy Inanna answers him: 
#tr.en: “Because lord Gud-gal-ana, 
#tr.en: the husband of my elder sister holy Ereškigal, has died; 
#tr.en: in order to have his funeral rites observed, 
#tr.en: she offers generous libations at his wake; that is the reason.” 
#tr.en: Neti, the chief doorman of the underworld, 
#tr.en: answers holy Inanna: 
#tr.en: “Stay here, Inanna. I will speak to my mistress. 
#tr.en: I will speak to my mistress Ereškigal and tell her what you have said.” 
#tr.en: Neti, the chief doorman of the underworld, 
#tr.en: to his mistress Ereškigal 
#tr.en: entered the house and said: 
#tr.en: “My mistress, there is a lone girl outside. 
#tr.en: It is Inanna, your sister, and she has arrived at the palace Ganzer. 
#tr.en: She pushed aggressively on the door of the underworld. 
#tr.en: She shouted aggressively at the gate of the underworld. 
#tr.en: She has abandoned Eanna and has descended to the underworld. 
#tr.en: “She has taken the 7 divine powers. 
#tr.en: She has collected the divine powers and grasped them in her hand. 
#tr.en: She has come on her way with all the good divine powers. 
#tr.en: She has put a turban, headgear for the open country, on her head. 
#tr.en: She has taken a wig for her forehead. 
#tr.en: She has hung small lapis-lazuli beads around her neck. 
#tr.en: “She has placed twin egg-shaped beads on her breast. 
#tr.en: She has covered her body with the pala dress of ladyship. 
#tr.en: She has placed mascara “Let a man come” on her eyes. 
#tr.en: She has pulled the pectoral “Come, man, come” over her breast. 
#tr.en: She has placed a golden ring on her hand. 
#tr.en: She is holding the lapis-lazuli ‘reed-1-ninda’ measuring rod and measuring line in her hand.” 
#tr.en: When she heard this, Ereškigal slapped the side of her thigh. 
#tr.en: She bit her lip and took the words to heart. 
#tr.en: She says to Neti, her chief doorman: 
#tr.en: “Come Neti, my chief doorman of the underworld, 
#tr.en: don’t neglect the instructions I will give you. 
#tr.en: Let the seven gates of the underworld be bolted. 
#tr.en: Then let each door of the palace Ganzer be opened separately. 
#tr.en: As for her, after she has entered, 
#tr.en: and crouched down and had her clothes removed, they will be carried away.” 
#tr.en: Neti, the chief doorman of the underworld, 
#tr.en: paid attention to the instructions of his mistress. 
#tr.en: He bolted the 7 gates of the underworld. 
#tr.en: Then he opened each of the doors of the palace Ganzer separately. 
#tr.en: He says to holy Inanna: 
#tr.en: “Come on, Inanna, and enter.” 
#tr.en: And when Inanna entered, 
#tr.en: the turban, headgear for the open country, was removed from her head. 
#tr.en: “What is this?” 
#tr.en: “Be satisfied, Inanna, a divine power of the underworld has been fulfilled. 
#tr.en: Inanna, you must not open your mouth against the rites of the underworld.” 
#tr.en: When she entered the 2nd gate, 
#tr.en: the small lapis-lazuli beads were removed from her neck. 
#tr.en: “What is this?” 
#tr.en: “Be satisfied, Inanna, a divine power of the underworld has been fulfilled. 
#tr.en: Inanna, you must not open your mouth against the rites of the underworld.” 
#tr.en: When she entered the 3rd gate, 
#tr.en: the twin egg-shaped beads were removed from her breast. 
#tr.en: “What is this?” 
#tr.en: “Be satisfied, Inanna, a divine power of the underworld has been fulfilled. 
#tr.en: Inanna, you must not open your mouth against the rites of the underworld.” 
#tr.en: When she entered the 4th gate, 
#tr.en: the pectoral “Come, man, come” was removed from her breast. 
#tr.en: “What is this?” 
#tr.en: “Be satisfied, Inanna, a divine power of the underworld has been fulfilled. 
#tr.en: Inanna, you must not open your mouth against the rites of the underworld.” 
#tr.en: When she entered the 5th gate, 
#tr.en: the golden ring was removed from her hand. 
#tr.en: “What is this?” 
#tr.en: “Be satisfied, Inanna, a divine power of the underworld has been fulfilled. 
#tr.en: Inanna, you must not open your mouth against the rites of the underworld.” 
#tr.en: When she entered the 6th gate, 
#tr.en: the lapis-lazuli measuring rod and measuring line were removed from her hand. 
#tr.en: “What is this?” 
#tr.en: “Be satisfied, Inanna, a divine power of the underworld has been fulfilled. 
#tr.en: Inanna, you must not open your mouth against the rites of the underworld.” 
#tr.en: When she entered the 7th gate, 
#tr.en: the pala dress, the garment of ladyship, was removed from her body. 
#tr.en: “What is this?” 
#tr.en: “Be satisfied, Inanna, a divine power of the underworld has been fulfilled. 
#tr.en: Inanna, you must not open your mouth against the rites of the underworld.” 
#tr.en: After she had crouched down and had her clothes removed, they were carried away. 
#tr.en: Then she made her sister Ereškigal rise from her throne, 
#tr.en: and instead she sat on her throne. 
#tr.en: The Anuna, the seven judges, rendered their decision against her. 
#tr.en: They looked at her—it was the look of death! 
#tr.en: They spoke to her—it was the speech of anger! 
#tr.en: They shouted at her—it was the shout of heavy guilt! 
#tr.en: The afflicted woman was turned into a corpse! 
#tr.en: And the corpse was hung on a hook. 
#tr.en: After 3 days and 3 nights had passed, 
#tr.en: her minister Ninšubur 
#tr.en: carried out the instructions of her mistress. 
#tr.en: She made a lament for her in her ruined (houses). 
#tr.en: She beat the drum for her in the sanctuaries. 
#tr.en: She made the rounds of the houses of the gods for her. 
#tr.en: She lacerated her eyes for her, she lacerated her nose. 
#tr.en: In private she lacerated her buttocks for her. 
#tr.en: Like a pauper, she clothed herself in a single garment, 
#tr.en: and all alone she set her foot in the E-kur, the house of Enlil. 
#tr.en: When she had entered the E-kur, the house of Enlil, 
#tr.en: she laments before Enlil: 
#tr.en: “Father Enlil, don’t let anyone kill your daughter in the underworld. 
#tr.en: Don’t let your precious metal be alloyed there with the dirt of the underworld. 
#tr.en: Don’t let your precious lapis lazuli be split there with the mason’s stone. 
#tr.en: Don’t let your boxwood be chopped up there with the carpenter’s wood. 
#tr.en: Don’t let young lady Inanna be killed in the underworld.” 
#tr.en: In his rage father Enlil answers Ninšubur: 
#tr.en: “My daughter craved the great heaven and she craved the great below as well. 
#tr.en: Inanna craved the great heaven and she craved the great below as well. 
#tr.en: The divine powers of the underworld are divine powers which should not be craved, for whoever gets them must remain in the underworld. 
#tr.en: Who, having got to that place, could then expect to come up again?” 
#tr.en: Thus father Enlil did not help in this matter, so she went to Ur. 
#tr.en: In the E-mud-kura at Ur, 
#tr.en: when she had entered the E-kišnugal, the house of Nanna, 
#tr.en: she laments before Nanna: 
#tr.en: “Father Nanna, don’t let your daughter be killed in the underworld. 
#tr.en: Don’t let your precious metal be alloyed there with the dirt of the underworld. 
#tr.en: Don’t let your precious lapis lazuli be split there with the mason’s stone. 
#tr.en: Don’t let your boxwood be chopped up there with the carpenter’s wood. 
#tr.en: Don’t let young lady Inanna be killed in the underworld.” 
#tr.en: In his rage father Nanna answers Ninšubur: 
#tr.en: “My daughter craved the great heaven and she craved the great below as well. 
#tr.en: Inanna craved the great heaven and she craved the great below as well. 
#tr.en: The divine powers of the underworld are divine powers which should not be craved, for whoever gets them must remain in the underworld. 
#tr.en: Who, having got to that place, could then expect to come up again?” 
#tr.en: Thus father Nanna did not help her in this matter, so she went to Eridu. 
#tr.en: In Eridu, when she had entered the house of Enki, 
#tr.en: xshe laments before Enki:xx 
#tr.en: “Father Enki, don’t let anyone kill your daughter in the underworld. 
#tr.en: Don’t let your precious metal be alloyed there with the dirt of the underworld. 
#tr.en: Don’t let your precious lapis lazuli be split there with the mason’s stone. 
#tr.en: Don’t let your boxwood be chopped up there with the carpenter’s wood. 
#tr.en: Don’t let young lady Inanna be killed in the underworld.” 
#tr.en: Father Enki answered Ninšubur: 
#tr.en: “What has my daughter done? She has me worried. 
#tr.en: What has Inanna done? She has me worried. 
#tr.en: What has the mistress of all the lands done? She has me worried. 
#tr.en: What has the hierodule of An done? She has me worried.” 
#tr.en: He removed some dirt from the tip of his fingernail and created the kur-gar. 
#tr.en: He removed some dirt from the tip of his 2nd fingernail and created the gala-tur. 
#tr.en: To the kur-gar he gave the life-giving plant. 
#tr.en: To the gala-tura he gave the life-giving water. 
#tr.en: Then father Enki speaks out to the gala-tura and the kur-gar: 
#tr.en: Go and direct your steps to the underworld. 
#tr.en: Flit past the door like flies. 
#tr.en: Slip through the door pivots like phantoms. 
#tr.en: The birth-mother, on account of her children, 
#tr.en: Ereškigal, is lying there. 
#tr.en: Her holy shoulders are not covered by a linen cloth. 
#tr.en: Her breasts are not full like a cagan vessel. 
#tr.en: Her nails are like a pickaxe (?) upon her. 
#tr.en: The hair on her head is bunched up as if it were leeks. 
#tr.en: “When she says “Oh my heart,” 
#tr.en: you are to say “You are troubled, our mistress, oh your heart.” 
#tr.en: When she says “Oh my liver,” 
#tr.en: you are to say “You are troubled, our mistress, oh your liver.” 
#tr.en: (She will then ask:) “Who are you? 
#tr.en: Speaking to you from my heart to your heart, from my liver to your liver— 
#tr.en: if you are gods, let me talk with you; 
#tr.en: if you are mortals, may a destiny be decreed for you.” 
#tr.en: Make her swear this by heaven and earth. 
#tr.en: Go on out, 
#tr.en: They will offer you a riverful of water—don’t accept it. 
#tr.en: They will offer you a field with its grain—don’t accept it. 
#tr.en: But say to her: “Give us the corpse hanging on the hook.” 
#tr.en: (She will answer:) “That is the corpse of your queen.” 
#tr.en: Say to her: “Whether it is that of our king, whether it is that of our queen, give it to us.” 
#tr.en: She will give you the corpse hanging on the hook. 
#tr.en: 1 of you sprinkle on it the life-giving plant and 1 the life-giving water. 
#tr.en: Thus let Inanna rise up.” 
#tr.en: The gala-tura and the kur-gar paid attention to the instructions of Enki. 
#tr.en: They flitted through the door like flies. 
#tr.en: They slipped through the door pivots like phantoms. 
#tr.en: The birth-mother, because of her children, 
#tr.en: Ereškigal, was lying there. 
#tr.en: Her holy shoulders were not covered by a linen cloth. 
#tr.en: Her breasts were not full like a cagan vessel. 
#tr.en: Her nails were like a pickaxe (?) upon her. 
#tr.en: The hair on her head was bunched up as if it were leeks. 
#tr.en: When she said “Oh my heart,” 
#tr.en: they said to her “You are troubled, our mistress, oh your heart.” 
#tr.en: When she said “Oh my liver,” 
#tr.en: they said to her “You are troubled, our mistress, oh your liver.” 
#tr.en: (Then she asked:) “Who are you? 
#tr.en: I tell you from my heart to your heart, from my liver to your liver— 
#tr.en: if you are gods, I will talk with you; 
#tr.en: if you are mortals, may a destiny be decreed for you.” 
#tr.en: They made her swear this by heaven and earth. 
#tr.en: they went on out, 
#tr.en: they were offered a river with its water—they did not accept it. 
#tr.en: They were offered a field with its grain—they did not accept it. 
#tr.en: They said to her: “Give us the corpse hanging on the hook.” 
#tr.en: Holy Ereškigal answers the gala-tura and the kur-gar: 
#tr.en: “The corpse is that of your queen.” 
#tr.en: They said to her: “Whether it is that of our king or that of our queen, give it to us.” 
#tr.en: They were given the corpse hanging on the hook. 
#tr.en: 1 of them sprinkled on it the life-giving plant and 1 the life-giving water. 
#tr.en: And thus Inanna rose up. 
#tr.en: Ereškigal says to the gala-tura and the kur-gar: 
#tr.en: “Bring your queen ..., your ... has been seized.” 
#tr.en: Inanna, because of Enki’s instructions, was about to ascend from the underworld. 
#tr.en: But as Inanna was about to ascend from the underworld, 
#tr.en: the Anuna seized her: 
#tr.en: “Who has ever ascended from the underworld, has ascended unscathed from the underworld? 
#tr.en: If Inanna is to ascend from the underworld, 
#tr.en: let her provide a substitute for herself.” 
#tr.en: So when Inanna left the underworld, 
#tr.en: the one in front of her, though not a minister, held a sceptre in his hand; 
#tr.en: the one behind her, though not an escort, carried a mace at his hip, 
#tr.en: while the small demons, like a reed enclosure, 
#tr.en: and the big demons, like the reeds of a fence, restrained her on all sides. 
#tr.en: Those who accompanied her, 
#tr.en: those who accompanied Inanna, 
#tr.en: know no food, know no drink, 
#tr.en: eat no flour offering 
#tr.en: and drink no libation. 
#tr.en: They accept no pleasant gifts.

#tr.en: She had sat in the dust and clothed herself in a filthy garment. 
#tr.en: The demons said to holy Inanna: 
#tr.en: “Inanna, proceed to your city, we will take her back.” 
#tr.en: Holy Inanna answers the demons: 
#tr.en: “This is my minister of fair words, 
#tr.en: my escort of trustworthy words. 
#tr.en: She did not forget my instructions. 
#tr.en: She did not neglect the orders I gave her. 
#tr.en: She made a lament for me on the ruin mounds. 
#tr.en: She beat the drum for me in the sanctuaries. 
#tr.en: She made the rounds of the gods’ houses for me. 
#tr.en: She lacerated her eyes for me, lacerated her nose for me. 
#tr.en: In private, she lacerated her buttocks for me. 
#tr.en: Like a pauper, she clothed herself in a single garment. 
#tr.en: “To the house of Enlil, 
#tr.en: and to Ur, to the house of Nanna, 
#tr.en: and to Eridu, to the house of Enki, 
#tr.en: all alone she directed her steps. 
#tr.en: She brought me back to life. 
#tr.en: How could I turn her over to you? 
#tr.en: Let us go on. Let us go on to the Šegkuršaga in Umma.” 
#tr.en: At the Šegkuršaga in Umma, 
#tr.en: Šara, in his own city, threw himself at her feet. 
#tr.en: He had sat in the dust and dressed himself in a filthy garment. 
#tr.en: The demons say to holy Inanna: 
#tr.en: “Inanna, proceed to your city, we will take him back.” 
#tr.en: Holy Inanna answered the demons: 
#tr.en: “Šara is my singer, 
#tr.en: my manicurist and my hairdresser. 
#tr.en: How could I turn him over to you? 
#tr.en: Let us go on. Let us go on to the E-muškalama in Bad-tibira.” 
#tr.en: At the E-muškalama in Bad-tibira, 
#tr.en: Lulal, in his own city, threw himself at her feet. 
#tr.en: He had sat in the dust and clothed himself in a filthy garment. 
#tr.en: The demons said to holy Inanna: 
#tr.en: “Inanna, proceed to your city, we will take him back.” 
#tr.en: Holy Inanna answers the demons: 
#tr.en: “Outstanding Lulal follows me at my right and my left. 
#tr.en: How could I turn him over to you? 
#tr.en: Let us go on. Let us go on to the great apple tree in the plain of Kulaba.” 
#tr.en: They followed her to the great apple tree in the plain of Kulaba. 
#tr.en: There was Dumuzi clothed in a magnificent garment and seated magnificently on a throne. 
#tr.en: The demons seized him there by his thighs. 
#tr.en: The 7 of them poured the milk from his churns. 
#tr.en: The seven of them shook their heads like ... 
#tr.en: They would not let the shepherd play the pipe and flute before her (?). 
#tr.en: She looked at him, it was the look of death. 
#tr.en: She spoke to him (?), it was the speech of anger. 
#tr.en: She shouted at him (?), it was the shout of heavy guilt: 
#tr.en: “How much longer? Take him away.” 
#tr.en: Holy Inanna gave Dumuzi the shepherd into their hands. 
#tr.en: Those who had accompanied her, 
#tr.en: who had come for Dumuzi, 
#tr.en: know no food, know no drink, 
#tr.en: eat no flour offering, 
#tr.en: drink no libation. 
#tr.en: They never enjoy the pleasures of the marital embrace, 
#tr.en: never have any sweet children to kiss. 
#tr.en: They snatch the son from a man’s knee. 
#tr.en: They make the bride leave the house of her father-in-law. 
#tr.en: Dumuzi let out a wail and turned very pale. 
#tr.en: The lad raised his hands to heaven, to Utu: 
#tr.en: “Utu, you are my brother-in-law. 
#tr.en: I am your relation by marriage. I brought butter oil to your mother’s house 
#tr.en: I brought cheese to Ningal’s house. 
#tr.en: Turn my hands into snake’s hands 
#tr.en: and turn my feet into snake’s feet, 
#tr.en: so I can escape my demons, let them not keep hold of me.” 
#tr.en: Utu accepted his tears. 
#tr.en: Utu turned Dumuzi’s hands into snake’s hands. 
#tr.en: He turned his feet into snake’s feet. 
#tr.en: Dumuzi escaped his demons. 
#tr.en: having seized ..., 
#tr.en: ... 
#tr.en: ... 
#tr.en: Holy Inanna ... her heart. 
#tr.en: Holy Inanna wept bitterly for her husband. 
#tr.en: Holy Inanna ... Dumuzi ... her heart ... 
#tr.en: ... her husband ... by force ... 
#tr.en: ... 
#tr.en: ... like ... 
#tr.en: She tore at her hair like esparto grass, she ripped it out like esparto grass. 
#tr.en: “You wives who lie in your men’s embrace, where is my precious husband? 
#tr.en: You children who lie in your men’s embrace, where is my precious child? 
#tr.en: Where is my man? Where ...? 
#tr.en: Where is my man? Where ...?” 
#tr.en: A fly speaks to holy Inanna: 
#tr.en: “If I show you where your man is, what will be my reward?” 
#tr.en: Holy Inanna answers the fly: 
#tr.en: “If you show me where my man is, I will give you this gift: 
#tr.en: I will cover ... .” 
#tr.en: The fly helped (?) holy Inanna. 
#tr.en: The young lady Inanna decreed the destiny of the fly: 
#tr.en: “In the beer-house and the tavern (?), may there ... for you. 
#tr.en: You will live (?) like the sons of the wise.” 
#tr.en: Now Inanna decreed this fate and thus it came to be. 
#tr.en: ... was weeping. 
#tr.en: She came up to the sister (?) and ... by the hand: 
#tr.en: “Now, alas, my ... 
#tr.en: You for half the year and your sister for half the year: 
#tr.en: when you are demanded, on that day you will stay, 
#tr.en: when your sister is demanded, on that day you will be released.” 
#tr.en: Thus holy Inanna gave Dumuzi as a substitute ...

#tr.en: Beliš-tikal heeded his king's words 
#tr.en: and prepared the moulds in the E-sikil, the fated house. 
#tr.en: The king spoke to Sargon: 
#tr.en: "Go and deliver my bronze hand-mirror (?) to the chief smith!" 
#tr.en: Sargon left the palace of Ur-Zababa. 
#tr.en: Holy inanna, however, did not cease to stand at his right hand side, 
#tr.en: and before he had come within five or 10 ninda of the E-sikil, the fated house, 
#tr.en: holy inanna turned around toward him and blocked his way, (saying:) 
#tr.en: "The E-sikil is a holy house! No one polluted with blood should enter it!" 
#tr.en: Thus he met the chief smith of the king only at the gate of the fated house. 
#tr.en: After he delivered the king's bronze hand-mirror (?) to the chief smith, 
#tr.en: Beliš-tikal, the chief smith, ...... and threw it into the mould like statues. 
#tr.en: After five or 10 days had passed, Sargon 
#tr.en: came into the presence of Ur-Zababa, his king; 
#tr.en: he came into the palace, firmly founded like a great mountain. 
#tr.en: King Ur-Zababa ...... and became frightened in his residence. 
#tr.en: He realised what was it about, but did not put into words, did not discuss it with anyone. 
#tr.en: Ur-Zababa became frightened in the bed-chamber, his holy residence. 
#tr.en: He realised what was it about, but did not put into words, did not discuss it with anyone. 
#tr.en: In those days, although writing words on tablets existed, putting tablets into envelopes did not yet exist. 
#tr.en: King Ur-Zababa despatched Sargon, the creature of the gods, 
#tr.en: with a message written on clay, which was about murdering Sargon 
#tr.en: to Lugal-zage-si in Uruk. 
#tr.en: With the wife of Lugal-zage-si ... 
#tr.en: She gave(?) her feminity as a shelter ... 
#tr.en: Lugal-zage-si did not ... the envoy. 
#tr.en: "Come! He directed his steps to brick-built E-ana!" 
#tr.en: Lugal-zage-si did not grasp it, he did not talk to the envoy. 
#tr.en: But as soon as he did talk to the envoy ... 
#tr.en: "Alas!" and sat in the dust. 
#tr.en: Lugal-zage-si replied to the envoy: 
#tr.en: "Envoy, Sargon does not yield." 
#tr.en: After he has submitted,Sargon ... Lugal-zage-si ... 
#tr.en: Sargon ... Lugal-zage-si ... 
#tr.en: Why .... Sargon ....? 
#tr.en: After Enlil’s frown 
#tr.en: had slain Kiš as if it were the Bull of Heaven, 
#tr.en: had slaughtered the house of the land of Uruk in the dust as if it were a mighty bull, 
#tr.en: Then, to Sargon, king of Agade, 
#tr.en: from the south as far as the highlands did Enlil 
#tr.en: give the rulership and kingship. 
#tr.en: at that time, holy inanna established the sanctuary of Agade 
#tr.en: as her celebrated woman’s domain; 
#tr.en: she set up her throne in Ulmaš. 
#tr.en: Like a young man building a house for the first time, 
#tr.en: like a girl establishing a woman’s domain, 
#tr.en: So that the warehouses would be provisioned; 
#tr.en: that dwellings would be founded in the city; 
#tr.en: that its people would eat splendid food; 
#tr.en: that its people would drink splendid beverages; 
#tr.en: that those bathed for holidays would rejoice in the courtyards; 
#tr.en: that the people would throng the places of celebration; 
#tr.en: that acquaintances would dine together; 
#tr.en: that foreigners would cruise about like unusual birds in the sky; 
#tr.en: that even Marhaši would be re-entered on the tribute rolls; 
#tr.en: that monkeys, mighty elephants, water buffalo, exotic animals 
#tr.en: would jostle each other in the public squares. 
#tr.en: as well as thoroughbred dogs, lions, {mountain ibexes}, and alum sheep with long wool 
#tr.en: holy inanna did not sleep as she ensured all of this. 
#tr.en: She then filled Agade’s stores for emmer wheat with gold, 
#tr.en: she filled its stores for white emmer wheat with silver; 
#tr.en: she delivered copper, tin, and blocks of lapis lazuli to its granaries 
#tr.en: and sealed its silos from outside. 
#tr.en: She endowed its old women with the gift of giving counsel, 
#tr.en: she endowed its old men with the gift of eloquence. 
#tr.en: She endowed its young women with the gift of entertaining, 
#tr.en: she endowed its young men with martial might, 
#tr.en: she endowed its little ones with joy 
#tr.en: The nursemaids who cared for the general’s children 
#tr.en: played the drumsticks. 
#tr.en: Inside the city tigi drums sounded; outside it, flutes and zamzam instruments. 
#tr.en: Its harbour where ships moored was full of joy. 
#tr.en: All foreign lands rested contentedly, 
#tr.en: and their people experienced happiness. 
#tr.en: Its king, the shepherd Naram-Suen, 
#tr.en: rose as the daylight on the holy throne of Agade. 
#tr.en: Its city wall, like a mountain, reached the heavens. 
#tr.en: Its city-gates were like the Tigris {going to} the sea 
#tr.en: when Inanna opened its portals 
#tr.en: and made Sumer bring its own possessions upstream by boats. 
#tr.en: The highland Martu, people ignorant of agriculture, 
#tr.en: brought spirited cattle and kids for her. 
#tr.en: The Meluḫans, the people of the black land, 
#tr.en: brought exotic wares up to her. 
#tr.en: Elam and Subir loaded themselves with goods for her as if they were packasses. 
#tr.en: All the governors, the temple administrators, 
#tr.en: and the accountants of the Gu-edina 
#tr.en: regularly supplied the monthly and New Year offerings. 
#tr.en: What a weariness all these caused at Agade’s city gates! 
#tr.en: Holy inanna could hardly receive all these offerings. 
#tr.en: As if she were a citizen there, she could not restrain (?) the desire (?) to prepare the ground for a temple. 
#tr.en: But the statement coming from the E-kur was disquieting. 
#tr.en: Because of Enlil (?) all Agade was reduced (?) to trembling, 
#tr.en: and terror befell inanna in Ulmaš. 
#tr.en: She left the city, returning to her home. 
#tr.en: Like someone abandoning the young women of her woman’s domain, 
#tr.en: Holy inanna abandoned the sanctuary of Agade 
#tr.en: Like a warrior hurrying to arms, 
#tr.en: she removed the gift of battle and fight from the city 
#tr.en: and handed them over to the enemy. 
#tr.en: Not even five or 10 days had passed 
#tr.en: and the jewels of rulership, the royal crown, 
#tr.en: the emblem and the royal throne bestowed on Agade, 
#tr.en: did Ninurta bring back into his E-šu-me-ša. 
#tr.en: Utu took away the eloquence of the city. 
#tr.en: Enki took away its wisdom. 
#tr.en: Its fearsomeness that reaches heaven, 
#tr.en: An took up into the midst of heaven. 
#tr.en: Its well-anchored holy mooring pole 
#tr.en: Enki tore out from the abzu. 
#tr.en: inanna took away its weapons. 
#tr.en: The life of Agade’s sanctuary was brought to an end as if it had been only the life of a tiny carp in the deep waters, 
#tr.en: and all the cities were watching it. 
#tr.en: Like a mighty elephant, it bent its neck to the ground 
#tr.en: while they all raised their horns like mighty bulls. 
#tr.en: Like a dying dragon, it dragged its head on the earth 
#tr.en: and they jointly deprived it of honour as in a battle. 
#tr.en: Enlil would not let the kingdom of Agade occupy a pleasant, lasting residence, 
#tr.en: that he would make its future altogether unfavourable, 
#tr.en: that he would make its temples shake and would scatter its treasures - 
#tr.en: - Naram-Suen saw that in a nocturnal vision. 
#tr.en: He realised what the dream was about, but did not put into words, and did not discuss it with anyone. 
#tr.en: ... temples shake ... 
#tr.en: ... perform (?) extispicy regarding (?) his temple ... 
#tr.en: Because of the E-kur, he put on mourning clothes, 
#tr.en: covered his chariot with a reed mat, 
#tr.en: tore the reed canopy off his ceremonial barge, 
#tr.en: and gave away his royal paraphernalia. 
#tr.en: Naram-Suen persisted for seven years! 
#tr.en: Who has ever seen a king burying his head in his hands for seven years? 
#tr.en: He realised what the dream was about, but did not put into words, and did not discuss it with anyone. 
#tr.en: Then he went to perform extispicy on a kid regarding the temple, 
#tr.en: but the omen had nothing to say about the building of the temple. 
#tr.en: For a second time he went to perform extispicy on a kid regarding the temple, 
#tr.en: but the omen again had nothing to say about the building of the temple. 
#tr.en: In order to change what had been inflicted (?) upon him, 
#tr.en: he tried to to alter Enlil’s pronouncement. 
#tr.en: Because his subjects were dispersed, 
#tr.en: he now began a mobilization of his troops. 
#tr.en: Like a wrestler who is about to enter the great courtyard, 
#tr.en: he ...... his hands towards (?) the E-kur. 
#tr.en: Like an athlete bent to start a contest, 
#tr.en: he treated the giguna as if it were worth only thirty shekels. 
#tr.en: Like a robber plundering the city, 
#tr.en: he set tall ladders against the temple. 
#tr.en: To demolish E-kur as if it were a huge ship, 
#tr.en: to break up its soil like the soil of mountains where precious metals are mined, 
#tr.en: to splinter it like the lapis lazuli mountain, 
#tr.en: to prostrate it like a city inundated by Iškur; 
#tr.en: alhough the temple was not the Mountains of Cedar-felling, 
#tr.en: he had large axes cast, 
#tr.en: he had double-edged agasilig axes sharpened to be used against it. 
#tr.en: He set spades against its roots 
#tr.en: and it sank as low as the foundation of the Land. 
#tr.en: He put axes against its top, 
#tr.en: and the temple, like a dead soldier, bowed its neck before him, 
#tr.en: and all the foreign lands bowed their necks before him. 
#tr.en: He ripped out its drain pipes, 
#tr.en: and all the rain went back to the heavens. 
#tr.en: He tore off its upper lintel and the Land was deprived of its ornament. 
#tr.en: From its Gate from which Grain is never Diverted, he diverted grain, 
#tr.en: and the Land was deprived of grain. 
#tr.en: He struck the Gate of Well-Being with the pickaxe, 
#tr.en: and well-being was subverted in all the foreign lands. 
#tr.en: As if they were for great tracts of land with wide carp-filled waters, 
#tr.en: he cast large spades to be used against the E-kur. 
#tr.en: The people could see the bedchamber, its room which knows no daylight. 
#tr.en: They could look into the holy treasure chest of the gods. 
#tr.en: its laḫama deities of the great pilasters standing at the temple, 
#tr.en: though they had committed no sacrilege, 
#tr.en: were thrown into the fire by Naram-Suen. 
#tr.en: The cedar, cypress, juniper and boxwood, 
#tr.en: the woods of its giguna, were ... by him. 
#tr.en: He put its gold in containers 
#tr.en: and put its silver in leather bags. 
#tr.en: He filled the docks with its copper, as if it were a huge transport of grain. 
#tr.en: The silversmiths were re-shaping its silver, 
#tr.en: jewellers were re-shaping its precious stones, 
#tr.en: smiths were beating its copper. 
#tr.en: Though they were not the goods of a plundered city, 
#tr.en: large ships were moored at the temple, 
#tr.en: large ships were moored at Enlil’s temple 
#tr.en: and its possessions were taken away from the city. 
#tr.en: With the possessions being taken away from the city, 
#tr.en: good sense left Agade. 
#tr.en: As the ships moved away from the docks, Agade’s intelligence was removed. 
#tr.en: The roaring storm that subjugates the entire land, 
#tr.en: the rising deluge that cannot be confronted, 
#tr.en: Enlil was considering what should be destroyed in return for the wrecking of his beloved E-kur. 
#tr.en: He lifted his gaze towards the Gubin mountains, 
#tr.en: and made all the inhabitants of the broad mountain ranges descend (?). 
#tr.en: Those who do not resemble other people, who are not reckoned as part of the Land, 
#tr.en: the Gutians, an unbridled people, 
#tr.en: with human intelligence but canine instincts and monkeys’ features - 
#tr.en: Enlil brought them out of the mountains. 
#tr.en: Like small birds they swooped on the ground in great flocks. 
#tr.en: Because of Enlil, they stretched their arms out across the plain like a net for animals. 
#tr.en: Nothing escaped their clutches, 
#tr.en: no one left their grasp. 
#tr.en: Messengers no longer travelled the highways, 
#tr.en: the courier’s boat no longer passed along the rivers. 
#tr.en: The Gutians drove the trusty (?) goats of Enlil out of their folds and compelled their herdsmen to follow them, they drove the cows out of their pens and compelled their cowherds to follow them. 
#tr.en: they drove the cows out of their pens and compelled their cowherds to follow them. 
#tr.en: Prisoners manned the watch. 
#tr.en: Brigands occupied the highways. 
#tr.en: The doors of the city gates of the Land lay dislodged in mud, 
#tr.en: and all the foreign lands uttered bitter cries from the walls of their cities. 
#tr.en: They established gardens for themselves within the cities, and not as usual on the wide plain outside. 
#tr.en: As if it had been before the time when cities were built and founded, 
#tr.en: the large arable tracts yielded no grain, 
#tr.en: the inundated tracts yielded no fish, 
#tr.en: the irrigated orchards yielded no syrup or wine, 
#tr.en: the thick clouds (?) did not rain, the mašgurum plant did not grow. 
#tr.en: In those days, oil for one shekel was only half a litre, 
#tr.en: grain for one shekel was only half a litre, 
#tr.en: wool for one shekel was only one mina, 
#tr.en: fish for one shekel filled only one ban measure 
#tr.en: these sold at such prices in the markets of the cities! 
#tr.en: Those who lay down on the roof, died on the roof; 
#tr.en: those who lay down in the house were not buried. 
#tr.en: People were flailing at themselves from hunger. 
#tr.en: By the Ki-ur, Enlil’s great place, 
#tr.en: dogs were packed together in the silent streets; 
#tr.en: if two men walked there they would be devoured by them, 
#tr.en: and if three men walked there they would be devoured by them. 
#tr.en: Noses were punched (?), heads were smashed (?), 
#tr.en: noses (?) were piled up, heads were sown like seeds. 
#tr.en: Honest people were confounded with traitors, 
#tr.en: heroes lay dead on top of heroes, 
#tr.en: the blood of traitors ran upon the blood of honest men. 
#tr.en: At that time, Enlil rebuilt his great sanctuaries 
#tr.en: into small reed (?) sanctuaries 
#tr.en: and from east to west he reduced their storehouses. 
#tr.en: The old women who survived those days, 
#tr.en: the old men who survived those days, 
#tr.en: and the chief lamentation singer who survived those years 
#tr.en: for seven days and seven nights 
#tr.en: set up seven balaĝ drums, 
#tr.en: ub, meze, and lilis drums made them resound to Enlil like Iškur. 
#tr.en: The old women did not restrain the cry “Alas for my city!” 
#tr.en: The old men did not restrain the cry “Alas for its people!” 
#tr.en: The lamentation singer did not restrain the cry “Alas for the E-kur!” 
#tr.en: Its young women did not restrain from tearing their hair. 
#tr.en: Its young men did not restrain from sharpening their knives. 
#tr.en: Their laments were as if Enlil’s ancestors 
#tr.en: were performing a lament in the awe-inspiring Holy Mound by the holy knees of Enlil. 
#tr.en: Because of this, Enlil entered his holy bedchamber and lay down fasting. 
#tr.en: At that time, Suen, Enki, inanna, Ninurta, Iškur, Utu, Nuska, and Nisaba, the great gods 
#tr.en: cooled Enlil’s heart with cool water and prayed to him: 
#tr.en: “Enlil, may the city that destroyed your city be treated as your city has been treated! 
#tr.en: May the one that defiled your giguna be treated as Nibru! 
#tr.en: In this city, may heads fill the wells! 
#tr.en: May no one find his acquaintances there, 
#tr.en: may brother not recognise brother! 
#tr.en: May its young woman be cruelly killed in her woman’s domain, 
#tr.en: may its old man cry in distress for his slain wife! 
#tr.en: May its pigeons moan on their window ledges, 
#tr.en: may its small birds be smitten in their nooks, 
#tr.en: may it live in constant anxiety like a timid pigeon!” 
#tr.en: Again, Suen, Enki, inanna, Ninurta, Iškur, Utu, Nuska and Nisaba, all the gods whosoever, 
#tr.en: turned their attention to the city, 
#tr.en: and cursed Agade severely: 
#tr.en: “City, you pounced on E-kur: it is as if you had pounced on Enlil! 
#tr.en: Agade, you pounced on E-kur: it is as if you had pounced on Enlil! 
#tr.en: May your holy walls, to their highest point, resound with mourning! 
#tr.en: May your giguna be reduced to a pile of dust! 
#tr.en: May your pilasters with the standing lahama deities 
#tr.en: fall to the ground like tall young men drunk on wine! 
#tr.en: May your clay be returned to its abzu, 
#tr.en: may it be clay cursed by Enki! 
#tr.en: May your grain be returned to its furrow, 
#tr.en: may it be grain cursed by Ezina! 
#tr.en: May your timber be returned to its forest, 
#tr.en: may it be timber cursed by Ninilduma! 
#tr.en: May the cattle slaughterer slaughter his wife, 
#tr.en: may your sheep butcher butcher his child! 
#tr.en: May water wash away your pauper as he is looking for ...! 
#tr.en: May your prostitute hang herself at the entrance to her brothel! 
#tr.en: May your pregnant (?) priestesses and cult prostitutes abort (?) their children! 
#tr.en: May your gold be bought for the price of silver, 
#tr.en: may your silver be bought for the price of pyrite (?), 
#tr.en: and may your copper be bought for the price of lead!” 
#tr.en: “Agade, may your strong man be deprived of his strength, 
#tr.en: so that he will be unable to lift his sack of provisions and ..., 
#tr.en: and will not have the joy of controlling your superior asses; may he lie idle all day! 
#tr.en: May this make the city die of hunger! 
#tr.en: May your citizens, who used to eat fine food, lie hungry, 
#tr.en: may your ... man 
#tr.en: eat the coating on his roof, 
#tr.en: The leather hinges on the main door of his father’s house, 
#tr.en: may he chew their leather hinges! 
#tr.en: May depression descend upon your palace, built for joy! 
#tr.en: May the evils of the desert, the silent place, howl continuously!” 
#tr.en: “Your uzga precinct, established for purification ceremonies, 
#tr.en: may foxes that frequent its ruin mounds and brush it with their tails 
#tr.en: Your gateways, established for the Land, 
#tr.en: May the ukuku, the bird of depression, make its nest in them! 
#tr.en: In your city that could not sleep because of the tigi drums, 
#tr.en: that could not rest from its joy, 
#tr.en: may the bulls of Nanna that fill the pens 
#tr.en: bellow like those who wander in the desert, the silent place! 
#tr.en: May the grass grow long on your canal-bank tow-paths, 
#tr.en: may the grass of mourning grow on your highways laid for waggons! 
#tr.en: Moreover, on your tow-paths built up with canal sediment, 
#tr.en: may ... wild rams (?) and alert snakes of the mountains allow no one to pass! 
#tr.en: In your plains where fine grass grows, may the reed of lamentation grow! 
#tr.en: Agade, may brackish water flow, where fresh water flowed for you! 
#tr.en: If someone decides, “I will dwell in this city!,” may he not enjoy the pleasures of a dwelling place! 
#tr.en: If someone decides, “I will rest in Agade!,” may he not enjoy the pleasures of a resting place!” 
#tr.en: And before Utu on that very day, so it was! 
#tr.en: On its canal bank tow-paths, the grass grew long. 
#tr.en: On its highways laid for waggons, the grass of mourning grew. 
#tr.en: Moreover, on its tow-paths built up with canal sediment, 
#tr.en: wild rams (?) and alert snakes of the mountains allowed no one to pass. 
#tr.en: On its plains, where fine grass grew, now the reeds of lamentation grew. 
#tr.en: Agade’s flowing fresh water flowed as brackish water. 
#tr.en: When someone decided, “I will dwell in that city!,” he could not enjoy the pleasures of a dwelling place. 
#tr.en: When someone decided, “I will rest in Agade!,” 
#tr.en: For the destruction of Agade, Inanna be praised! 
#tr.en: Enki took away its wisdom. 
#tr.en: Its fearsomeness that reaches heaven, 
#tr.en: An took it up into the midst of heaven. 
#tr.en: Its well-anchored holy mooring pole, 
#tr.en: Enki tore it out from the abzu 
#tr.en: That he would make its future altogether unfavourable; 
#tr.en: that he would make its temples shake and would scatter its treasures - 
#tr.en: - Naram-Suen saw that in a nocturnal vision. 
#tr.en: as if he were to change what had been inflicted (?) upon him. 
#tr.en: His subjects were dispersed, 
#tr.en: so he began a mobilization of his troops. 
#tr.en: Like a wrestler who is about to enter the great courtyard, 
#tr.en: he ... his hands towards (?) the E-kur. 
#tr.en: Like an athlete bent to start a contest, 
#tr.en: he treated the giguna as if it were worth only thirty shekels. 
#tr.en: Like a robber plundering the city, 
#tr.en: he set tall ladders against the temple. 
#tr.en: Though the temple was not a mountain of cedars, 
#tr.en: he had large axes cast to be used against it. 
#tr.en: He had double-edged agasilig axes sharpened to be used against it. 
#tr.en: As if they were for great tracts of land with huge carp-filled waters, 
#tr.en: he cast large spades. 
#tr.en: He put spades against its roots. 
#tr.en: and the Land was deprived of grain. 
#tr.en: He struck the Gate of Well-Being with the pickaxe 
#tr.en: and well-being was destroyed in all the foreign lands. 
#tr.en: Noses were punched, heads were smashed (?), 
#tr.en: noses (?) were piled up, heads were sown like seeds. 
#tr.en: Heroes lay (?) dead on top of heroes, 
#tr.en: the blood of traitors ran (?) upon honest men. 
#tr.en: Enlil rebuilt his great sanctuaries 
#tr.en: into small reed (?) sanctuaries 
#tr.en: and from the south to the uplands ...

#tr.en: The munzer-fed cows took an unfamiliar path in an open country that they did not know. 
#tr.en: Gayau, who loves cows, dropped his weapon in the dung. 
#tr.en: Šuni-dug, who stores butter and cheese, did not store butter and cheese. 
#tr.en: Those who are unfamiliar with butter were churning the butter. 
#tr.en: Those who are unfamiliar with milk were curdling (?) the milk. 
#tr.en: The sound of the churning vat did not resound in the cattle-pen. 
#tr.en: Like mighty coals that once burnt, its smoke is extinguished. 
#tr.en: The great dining hall of Nanna ... 
#tr.en: Suen wept to his father Enlil: 
#tr.en: “O father who begot me, why have you turned away from my city which was built (?) for you? 
#tr.en: O Enlil, why have you turned away from my Ur which was built (?) for you? 
#tr.en: The boat with first-fruit offerings no longer brings first-fruit offerings to the father who begot him. 
#tr.en: Your food offerings can no longer be brought to Enlil in Nibru. 
#tr.en: The en priests of the countryside and city have been carried off by phantoms. 
#tr.en: Ur, like a city raked by a hoe, is to be counted as a ruin-mound. 
#tr.en: The Du-ur, Enlil's resting-place, has become a haunted shrine. 
#tr.en: O Enlil, gaze upon your city, an empty wasteland. 
#tr.en: Gaze upon your city Nibru, an empty wasteland.” 
#tr.en: “The dogs of Ur no longer sniff at the base of the city wall. 
#tr.en: The man who used to drill large wells scratches the ground in the market place. 
#tr.en: My father who begot me, enclose in your embrace my city which is all alone. 
#tr.en: Enlil, return to your embrace my Ur which is all alone. 
#tr.en: Enclose in your embrace my E-kiš-nu-gal which is all alone. 
#tr.en: May you bring forth offspring in Ur, may you multiply its people. 
#tr.en: May you restore the divine powers of Sumer that have been forgotten.” 
#tr.en: 3rd kirugu. 
#tr.en: O good house, good house! O its people, its people! 
#tr.en: Ĝišgigal. 
#tr.en: Enlil then answered his son Suen: 
#tr.en: “There is lamentation in the haunted city, reeds of mourning grow there. 
#tr.en: (1 ms. adds 1 line:) In its midst there is lamentation, reeds of mourning grow there. 
#tr.en: In its midst the people pass their days in sighing. 
#tr.en: (1 ms. adds 1 line:) My son, the noble son ..., why do you concern yourself with crying? 
#tr.en: Oh Nanna, the noble son ..., why do you concern yourself with crying? 
#tr.en: The judgment uttered by the assembly cannot be reversed. 
#tr.en: The word of An and Enlil knows no overturning. 
#tr.en: Ur was indeed given kingship but it was not given an eternal reign. 
#tr.en: From time immemorial, since the Land was founded, until people multiplied, 
#tr.en: who has ever seen a reign of kingship that would take precedence for ever? 
#tr.en: The reign of its kingship had been long indeed but had to exhaust itself. 
#tr.en: O my Nanna, do not exert yourself in vain, abandon your city.” 
#tr.en: Then my king, the noble son, became distraught. 
#tr.en: Lord Ašimbabbar, the noble son, grieved. 
#tr.en: Nanna who loves his city left his city. 
#tr.en: Suen took an unfamiliar path away from his beloved Ur. 
#tr.en: In order to go as an exile from her city to foreign territory, 
#tr.en: Ningal quickly clothed herself and left the city. 
#tr.en: The Anuna stepped outside of Ur. 
#tr.en: ... approached Ur 
#tr.en: The trees of Ur were sick, its reeds were sick. 
#tr.en: Laments sounded all along its city wall. 
#tr.en: Daily there was slaughter before it. 
#tr.en: Large axes were sharpened in front of Ur. 
#tr.en: The spears, the arms of battle, were prepared. 
#tr.en: The large bows, throw-sticks and shields gathered together to strike. 
#tr.en: The barbed arrows covered its outer side like a raining cloud. 
#tr.en: Large stones fell toegether with great thuds. 
#tr.en: (1 ms. adds 1 line:) Daily the evil wind returned in the city. 
#tr.en: Ur, confident in its own strength, stood ready for the murderers. 
#tr.en: Its people, oppressed by the enemy, could not withstand their weapons. 
#tr.en: In the city, those who had not been felled by weapons succumbed to hunger. 
#tr.en: Hunger filled the city like water, it would not cease. 
#tr.en: This hunger contorted people's faces, twisted their muscles. 
#tr.en: Its people were as if drowning in a pond, they gasped for breath. 
#tr.en: Its king breathed heavily in his own palace. 
#tr.en: Its people dropped their weapons, their weapons hit the ground. 
#tr.en: They struck their necks with their hands and cried. 
#tr.en: They sought counsel with each other, they searched for clarification: 
#tr.en: “Alas, what can we say about it? What more can we add to it? 
#tr.en: How long until we are finished off by this catastrophe? 
#tr.en: Inside Ur there is death, outside it there is death. 
#tr.en: Inside it we are to be finished off by famine. Outside it we are to be finished off by Elamite weapons. 
#tr.en: In Ur the enemy oppresses us, oh, we are finished.” 
#tr.en: In Ur the enemy oppresses us, oh, we are finished.” 
#tr.en: The people took refuge (?) behind the city walls. They were united in fear. 
#tr.en: The palace that was destroyed by onrushing water was defiled, its doorbolts were torn out. 
#tr.en: Elam, like a swelling flood wave, left (?) only the ghosts. 
#tr.en: In Ur weapons smashed heads like clay pots. 
#tr.en: Its refugees were unable to flee, they were trapped inside the walls. 
#tr.en: (1 ms. adds 3 lines:) Like fish living in a pond, they tried to escape. 
#tr.en: The enemy seized the E-kiš-nu-gal of Nanna. 
#tr.en: They ripped out its heavy ... 
#tr.en: The statues that were in the shrine were cut down. 
#tr.en: The great stewardess Ninigara ran away from the storehouse. 
#tr.en: Its throne was cast down before it, she threw herself down into the dust. 
#tr.en: Its mighty cows with shining horns were captured, their horns were cut off. 
#tr.en: Its unblemished oxen and grass-fed sheep were slaughtered. 
#tr.en: (1 ms. adds 1 line:) They were cut down as date palms and were tied together. 
#tr.en: The palm-trees, strong as mighty copper, the heroic strength, 
#tr.en: were torn out like rushes, were plucked like rushes, their trunks were turned sideways. 
#tr.en: Their tops lay in the dust, there was no one to raise them. 
#tr.en: The midribs of their palm fronds were cut off and their tops were burnt off. 
#tr.en: Their date spadices that used to fall (?) on the well were torn out. 
#tr.en: The fertile reeds, which grew in the sacred ..., were defiled. 
#tr.en: The great tribute that they had collected was hauled off to the mountains. 
#tr.en: The house's great door ornament fell down, its parapet was destroyed. 
#tr.en: The wild animals that were intertwined on its left and right 
#tr.en: lay before it like heroes smitten by heroes. 
#tr.en: Its gaping-mouthed dragons and its awe-inspiring lions 
#tr.en: were pulled down with ropes like captured wild bulls and carried off to enemy territory. 
#tr.en: The fragrance of the sacred seat of Nanna, formerly like a fragrant cedar grove, was destroyed. 
#tr.en: (1 ms. adds 1 line:) Its architrave ... gold and lapis lazuli. 
#tr.en: The glory of the house, whose glory was once so lovely, was extinguished. 
#tr.en: Like a storm that fills all the lands, it was built there like twilight in the heavens; 
#tr.en: its doors adorned with the heavenly stars, 
#tr.en: its ... Great bronze latches ... were torn out. 
#tr.en: Its hinges ... Together with its door fittings it (?) wept bitterly like a fugitive. 
#tr.en: The bolt, the holy lock and the great door were not fastened for it. 
#tr.en: The noise of the door being fastened had ceased; 
#tr.en: there was no one to fasten it. 
#tr.en: The ... and was put out in the square. 
#tr.en: The food offerings ... of his royal dining place were altered. 
#tr.en: In its sacred place (?) the tigi, šem and ala instruments did not sound. 
#tr.en: Its mighty tigi ... did not perform its sacred song. 
#tr.en: There was no eloquence in the Dubla-maḫ, the place where oaths used to be taken. 
#tr.en: The throne was not set up at its place of judgment, justice was not administered. 
#tr.en: Alamuš threw down his sceptre, his hands trembling. 
#tr.en: In the sacred bedchamber of Nanna musicians no longer played the balag drum. 
#tr.en: The sacred box that no one had set eyes upon was seen by the enemy. 
#tr.en: The divine bed was not set up, it was not spread with clean hay. 
#tr.en: The statues that were in the shrine were cut down. 
#tr.en: The cook, the dream interpreter, and the seal keeper did not perform the ceremonies properly. 
#tr.en: They stood by submissively and were carried off by the foreigners. 
#tr.en: The priests of the holy uzga shrine and the sacred lustrations, the linen-clad priests, 
#tr.en: forsook the divine plans and sacred divine powers, they went off to a foreign city. 
#tr.en: In his grief Suen approached his father. 
#tr.en: He went down on his knee in front of Enlil, the father who begot him: 
#tr.en: “O father who begot me, how long will the enemy eye be cast upon my account, how long ...? 
#tr.en: he lordship and the kingship that you bestowed ..., 
#tr.en: Father Enlil, the one who advises with just words, 
#tr.en: the wise words of the Land ..., 
#tr.en: your inimical judgment 
#tr.en: look into your darkened heart, terrifying like waves. 
#tr.en: O Father Enlil, the fate that you have decreed cannot be explained, 
#tr.en: as for my hairstyle (?) of lordship and the diadem with which I was crowned.” 
#tr.en: ... he put on a garment of mourning. 
#tr.en: Enlil then provided a favourable response to his son Suen: 
#tr.en: “My son, the city built for you in joy and prosperity was given to you as your reign. 
#tr.en: Destroying the city, overthrowing its great wall and battlements: all this too is part of that reign. 
#tr.en: ... the black, black days of the reign that has been your lot. 
#tr.en: As for dwelling in your home, the E-temen-ni-guru, that was properly built - 
#tr.en: - indeed Ur shall be rebuilt in splendour, the people shall bow down to you. 
#tr.en: There is to be bounty at its base, there is to be grain. 
#tr.en: There is to be splendour at its top, the sun shall rejoice there. 
#tr.en: Let an abundance of grain embrace its table. 
#tr.en: May Ur, the city whose fate was pronounced by An, be restored for you.” 
#tr.en: Having pronounced his blessing, Enlil raised his head toward the heavens: 
#tr.en: “May the land, south and highland, be organised for Nanna. 
#tr.en: May the roads of the mountains be set in order for Suen. 
#tr.en: Like a cloud hugging the earth, they shall submit to him. 
#tr.en: By order of An and Enlil it shall be conferred.” 
#tr.en: Father Nanna came into his city of Ur with head raised high. 
#tr.en: The youth Suen could enter again into the E-kiš-nu-gal. 
#tr.en: Ningal refreshed herself in her sacred living quarters. 
#tr.en: (1 ms. adds 1 line:) In Ur she could enter again into her E-kiš-nu-gal. 
#tr.en: 4th kirugu. 
#tr.en: There is lamentation in the haunted city, mourning reeds grew there. 
#tr.en: In its midst there is lamentation, mourning reeds grew there. 
#tr.en: Its people spend their days in moaning. 
#tr.en: Ĝišgigal. 
#tr.en: O bitter storm, retreat, O storm, storm return to your home. 
#tr.en: O storm that destroys cities, retreat, O storm, storm return to your home. 
#tr.en: O storm that destroys houses, retreat, O storm, storm return to your home. 
#tr.en: Indeed the storm that blew on Sumer, blew also on the foreign lands. 
#tr.en: Indeed the storm that blew on the land, blew on the foreign lands. 
#tr.en: It has blown on Tidnum, it has blown on the foreign lands. 
#tr.en: It has blown on Gutium, it has blown on the foreign lands. 
#tr.en: It has blown on Anšan, it has blown on the foreign lands. 
#tr.en: It levelled Anšan like a blowing evil wind. 
#tr.en: Famine has overwhelmed the evildoer; those people will have to submit. 
#tr.en: May An not change the divine powers of heaven, the divine plans for treating the people with justice. 
#tr.en: May An not change the decisions and judgments to lead the people properly. 
#tr.en: To travel on the roads of the Land: may An not change it. 
#tr.en: May An and Enlil not change it, may An not change it. 
#tr.en: May Enki and Ninmaḫ not change it, may An not change it. 
#tr.en: That the Tigris and Euphrates should again carry water: may An not change it. 
#tr.en: That there should be rain in the skies and on the ground speckled barley: may An not change it. 
#tr.en: That there should be watercourses with water and fields with grain: may An not change it.

#tr.en: that the sea should bring forth every abundance: may An not change it. 
#tr.en: The land densely populated from south to uplands: may An not change it. 
#tr.en: May An and Enlil not change it, may An not change it. 
#tr.en: May Enki and Ninmaḫ not change it, may An not change it. 
#tr.en: That cities should be rebuilt, that people should be numerous, 
#tr.en: hat in the whole universe the people should be cared for; 
#tr.en: O Nanna, your kingship is sweet, return to your place. 
#tr.en: May a good abundant reign be long-lasting in Ur. 
#tr.en: Let its people lie down in safe pastures, let them reproduce. 
#tr.en: O mankind ..., princess overcome by lamentation and crying! 
#tr.en: O Nanna! O your city! O your house! O your people!

#tr.en: After the cattle pen had been built for the foremost divine powers - 
#tr.en: - how did it become a haunted place? When will it be restored? 
#tr.en: Where once the brick of fate had been laid - 
#tr.en: - who scattered its divine powers? The lamentation is reprised: 
#tr.en: how did the storeroom of Nibru, the shrine Dur-an-ki, 
#tr.en: become a haunted place? When will it be restored? 
#tr.en: After Ki-ur, the great place, had been built, 
#tr.en: after the brickwork of E-kur had been built 
#tr.en: after Ubšu-ukkena had been built, 
#tr.en: after the shrine Egal-maḫ had been built - 
#tr.en: - how did they become haunted? When will they be restored? 
#tr.en: How did the true city become empty? 
#tr.en: Its precious designs have been defiled! 
#tr.en: How were the city's festivals neglected? 
#tr.en: Its magnificent rites have been thrown into disorder! 
#tr.en: In the heart of Nibru, where the divine powers were allotted 
#tr.en: and the black-headed people prolificly multiplied, 
#tr.en: the city's heart no longer revealed any sign of intelligence - 
#tr.en: - there where the Anuna used to give advice! 
#tr.en: In Ubšu-ukkena, the place for making great judgments, 
#tr.en: they no longer impart decisions or justice! 
#tr.en: Where its gods had established their dwellings, 
#tr.en: where their daily rations were offered, their daises erected, 
#tr.en: where the sacred royal offering (?) and the evening meal in their great banquet hall 
#tr.en: were destined for the pouring out of choice beer and syrup - 
#tr.en: - Nibru, the city where, in its spreading shade, 
#tr.en: the black-headed people used to cool themselves - 
#tr.en: - in their dwellings Enlil fell upon them as if they were criminals. 
#tr.en: It was he who sent them scattering, like a scattered herd of cattle. 
#tr.en: The inner city, whose bitter tears were overwhelming, 
#tr.en: How long until its lady, the goddess Ninlil, would ask after it? 
#tr.en: That great temple whose bustle of activity was famous, 
#tr.en: as though it were empty wasteland, no one enters it. 
#tr.en: As for all the great rulers who increased the wealth of the city of Nibru - why did they disappear? 
#tr.en: Where the black-headed people ate rich grass like sheep, 
#tr.en: For how long would Enlil neglect that Land? ears, lamentation, depression and despair! 
#tr.en: How long would his spirit burn and his heart not be placated? 
#tr.en: Why were those who once played the šem and ala drums 
#tr.en: spending their time in bitter lamenting? 
#tr.en: Why were the lamenters sitting in its brick buildings? 
#tr.en: They were bewailing the hardship which beset them. 
#tr.en: The men whose wives had fallen, whose children had fallen, 
#tr.en: were singing “Oh our destroyed city!.” 
#tr.en: Their city gone, their homes abandoned - 
#tr.en: - as those who were singing for the brick buildings of the good city, 
#tr.en: as the lamenters of wailing, 
#tr.en: like the foster-children of an ecstatic no longer knowing their own intelligence, 
#tr.en: the people were smitten, their minds thrown into disorder. 
#tr.en: The true temple wails bitterly. 
#tr.en: 1st kirugu 
#tr.en: ...built the temple, Ninlil... 
#tr.en: Its gišgigal 
#tr.en: The true temple gave you only tears and lamentation - 
#tr.en: - it sings a bitter song of the proper cleansing-rites that are forgotten! 
#tr.en: The brickwork of E-kur gave you only tears and lamentation - 
#tr.en: - it sings a bitter song of the proper cleansing-rites that are forgotten! 
#tr.en: It weeps bitter tears over the splendid rites and most precious plans which are desecrated - 
#tr.en: - its most sacred food rations neglected and ... into funeral offerings, it cries “Alas!.” 
#tr.en: The temple despairs of its divine powers, utterly cleansed, pure, hallowed, which are now defiled! 
#tr.en: The true temple, which it is bitter to enter on one's own, 
#tr.en: passes the time renewing its tears. 
#tr.en: Because the sealings of the abundant materials stored in the temple have been broken open, they have placed the loads on the ground. 
#tr.en: Because the property in its well-tended storehouses has been sent back, it says “What will they weigh out for me now?"; 
#tr.en: because the enemies who do not know good from evil have cut off all good things, it sings a bitter dirge; 
#tr.en: because they have finished off its populace there like animals, it cries “Oh my Land!.” 
#tr.en: Because they have piled up the young women, young men and their little children like heaps of grain, it cries “Woe!” for them. 
#tr.en: Because they have splashed their blood on the ground like a rain-storm, there is no restraint to its crying. 
#tr.en: The temple, like a cow whose calf is cut off, groans bitterly to itself; 
#tr.en: it is grief-stricken, and the sweet-voiced lamenters, like nursemaids singing a lullaby, respond tearfully with its name. 
#tr.en: In anguish they bewail the fact that the city's lord has smashed heads there, 
#tr.en: that he has looked away from it and toward a foreign land instead. 
#tr.en: The true temple of all the countries, which had come before him - 
#tr.en: the black-headed people, who had taken a true path, 
#tr.en: what have they done regarding what have they forsaken, 
#tr.en: that their lord has become enraged with them and walks in anger? 
#tr.en: 2nd kirugu 
#tr.en: It voices bitter cries because he has removed the great divine powers from within it. 
#tr.en: Its gišgigal. 
#tr.en: The city's lord who became angry with it, 
#tr.en: How long will he not turn to it, not say “Alas!” for it? 
#tr.en: Why did he cut off the road to its brickwork? 
#tr.en: He made the noisy pigeons fly away from their windows. 
#tr.en: Why did he transform the appearance of the temple which knew voices, where they used to while away the days in sweet playing of tigi drums in the brick buildings? 
#tr.en: The temple, once a place to offer salutations in humility, 
#tr.en: is now as deathly silent as a temple which no one reveres! 
#tr.en: As though its purification priest's equipment were not utterly sacred, 
#tr.en: as though its cleansing-rites did not bring calm in all countries, 
#tr.en: he has abandoned it, turned his breast away from it, 
#tr.en: among dejection and lamentation he has made it a sacrilege. 
#tr.en: After its fate, how long till his face would be streaked with teardrops? 
#tr.en: He rejected it thus as though it were a blasphemy! 
#tr.en: Why has joy left its brickwork? 
#tr.en: Night and day he has filled its heart with tears! 
#tr.en: Even now, he has made it foreign and a sacrilege! 
#tr.en: Its lord, who has despoiled it like an evil wind, 
#tr.en: has destroyed that city and its temples! 
#tr.en: He has ripped out their foundations, struck them with the adze, 
#tr.en: killed wives and their children within it, 
#tr.en: he has turned that city into a deserted city - 
#tr.en: - when would he restore its ancient property? 
#tr.en: Its possessions have been carried off by the wind! 
#tr.en: Enlil turned the city which used to be there into a city no longer! 
#tr.en: He made its mind wander! 
#tr.en: He threw its intelligence into disorder and made it haunted! 
#tr.en: He took away its food and its water! 
#tr.en: He brought to an end its days of familiarity with milk and with beer! 
#tr.en: The temple which he has made a sacrilege utters bitter lamentations; 
#tr.en: he has made its eyes blurred with tears. 
#tr.en: The lamenters who perform the dirges 
#tr.en: respond to it sorrowfully. 
#tr.en: The city's lord who has removed its divine powers - 
#tr.en: no one touches his arm, no one intercedes! 
#tr.en: 3rd kirugu 
#tr.en: How did Enlil make all his greatest divine powers fly away! 
#tr.en: No one ever touches his arm! No one ever intercedes! 
#tr.en: Its gišgigal 
#tr.en: To my dirge singer of bitter fates 
#tr.en: I am going down and I shall weep tearfully to him. 
#tr.en: Even now the lamenters who are expert in song 
#tr.en: make ululating wails over me! 
#tr.en: Now my people who are overcome by hardship 
#tr.en: voice laments for me one by one! 
#tr.en: Even now the places of refuge of my people whose hearts are burning in dark distress 
#tr.en: have been made known to me! 
#tr.en: My people whose hearts have been broken on the bitter way 
#tr.en: perform the lullabies of my young ones for me in tears! 
#tr.en: The well-built houses, ladies' dwellings, 
#tr.en: were falsely founded, and they have been eroded by the winds! 
#tr.en: Of how the foe has finished off my Land 
#tr.en: They are making a lament! 
#tr.en: They are addressing the cries of my heart, overwhelmed with bitterness, in order to soothe it! 
#tr.en: They are beginning their laments about my lord! 
#tr.en: He will have mercy and compassion on me - 
#tr.en: Enlil, father of the black-headed people, 
#tr.en: he who will give the order to restore me! 
#tr.en: 4th kirugu 
#tr.en: My heart is dark, I am destroyed, I am in chaos, I have been devastated! 
#tr.en: Its gišgigal 
#tr.en: In the foremost brick buildings they sing that your fate is bitter! 
#tr.en: Even now, to Enlil who will accept your tears for you, 
#tr.en: weeping bitter tears of your own accord, 
#tr.en: speak supplications to your lord himself concerning what he did to you, concerning that fate! 
#tr.en: “My lord, how long? Look upon me with favour, my lord!" 
#tr.en: Say “Why ...?” 
#tr.en: Say “May your heart be soothed for me - overturn this sacrilege for your own good! The day is ...!" 
#tr.en: Say “Re-enter for me your dwelling in my darkened shrines!" 
#tr.en: Say “Like a bright, cleansed, sacred day, give ... for your own good!" 
#tr.en: Say “...!" 
#tr.en: Say “Your misfortunes ... will rebuild it!"

#tr.en: Inaccessible fortresses round about I conquered. As tribute of horses

#tr.en: no king among kings 
#tr.en: ever 
#tr.en: Armanam

#tr.en: Upper 
#tr.en: he bestowed upon him,

#tr.en: of Dagan, 
#tr.en: the exalter 
#tr.en: of his kingship, 
#tr.en: Naram-Sin 
#tr.en: the mighty 
#tr.en: Armanum 
#tr.en: and

#tr.en: he smote, so that 
#tr.en: the earth basket 
#tr.en: of Ilaba 
#tr.en: his god 
#tr.en: they (now) bear. 
#tr.en: Further 
#tr.en: Amanus, 
#tr.en: the Mountain 
#tr.en: of Cedar, 
#tr.en: he did conquer. 
#tr.en: When 
#tr.en: the god Dagan 
#tr.en: the verdict 
#tr.en: (for) Naram-Sin 
#tr.en: the mighty 
#tr.en: did give, and 
#tr.en: Rida-Adad, 
#tr.en: king 
#tr.en: of Armanum 
#tr.en: into his hands 
#tr.en: did give, and 
#tr.en: he himself (Naram-Sin) 
#tr.en: in the middle 
#tr.en: of his (palace) entryway 
#tr.en: did capture him, 
#tr.en: with diorite 
#tr.en: a statue of himself 
#tr.en: he created, and 
#tr.en: to 
#tr.en: the god Sin 
#tr.en: he dedicated it. 
#tr.en: Thus (says) 
#tr.en: Naram-Sin 
#tr.en: the mighty, 
#tr.en: king 
#tr.en: of the world quarters 
#tr.en: the four: 
#tr.en: The god Dagan 
#tr.en: Armanum 
#tr.en: and 
#tr.en: Ebla 
#tr.en: did give me, and 
#tr.en: Rid-Adad, 
#tr.en: king 
#tr.en: of Armanum 
#tr.en: I captured, and 
#tr.en: at that time 
#tr.en: an image of myself 
#tr.en: I created, and 
#tr.en: to 
#tr.en: Sin 
#tr.en: I presented it. 
#tr.en: Let no one 
#tr.en: my inscription 
#tr.en: remove, (rather) 
#tr.en: my statue 
#tr.en: before 
#tr.en: Sin 
#tr.en: let it stand. 
#tr.en: Further, 
#tr.en: that which his god 
#tr.en: shall give to him, 
#tr.en: may it 'go' for him, 
#tr.en: (but) the task 
#tr.en: I performed(?)

#tr.en: into silver Inanna’s luxuriant garden.” 
#tr.en: “I, the woman, planted the tree not with my hands, but with my feet.

#tr.en: In the matter which his sister had told him about, 
#tr.en: her brother, the warrior Gilgamesh, stood by her. 
#tr.en: to his waist his ... belt of 50 minas weight he strapped— 
#tr.en: 50 minas were to him as 30 shekels. 
#tr.en: His bronze axe used for expeditions, 
#tr.en: which weighs 7 talents and 7 minas, in his hand he took; 
#tr.en: He killed the snake immune to incantations living at its roots. 
#tr.en: The Anzu bird living in its branches took up its young and went into the mountains. 
#tr.en: The phantom maid living in its trunk left (?) her dwelling 
#tr.en: and sought refuge in the wilderness. 
#tr.en: As for the tree, he uprooted it and stripped its branches, 
#tr.en: and the sons of his city, who went with him, 
#tr.en: cut up its branches and bundled them 
#tr.en: He gave it to his sister silver Inanna for her chair. 
#tr.en: He gave it to her for her bed. 
#tr.en: As for himself, from its roots, he manufactured his ball (?) 
#tr.en: and, from its branches, he manufactured his mallet (?). 
#tr.en: He played with the ball (?) in the broad square, never wanting to stop playing it, 
#tr.en: and he praised himself in the broad square, never wanting to stop praising himself. 
#tr.en: The young men of his city were playing with the ball (?). 
#tr.en: For (?) him who made the team of the widows’ children ..., 
#tr.en: they lamented: “O my neck! O my hips!” 
#tr.en: For those that had a mother, bread for her son she brought; 
#tr.en: for those that had a sister, she poured water for her brother. 
#tr.en: As the evening came, 
#tr.en: he marked the spot where the ball (?) had been placed, 
#tr.en: and he picked up his ball (?) from in front of him and took it home. 
#tr.en: But early in the morning as he ... the place marked, 
#tr.en: the widows’ accusation 
#tr.en: and the young girls’ complaint 
#tr.en: caused his ball (?) and his mallet (?) to fall down to the bottom of the nether world. 
#tr.en: He could not reach them by ... 
#tr.en: He tried with his hand but could not reach them, 
#tr.en: tried with his foot but could not reach them. 
#tr.en: At the gate of Ganzer, in front of the nether world, he sat down. 
#tr.en: Gilgamesh wept, crying bitterly: 
#tr.en: “O my ball (?)! O my mallet (?)! 
#tr.en: My ball (?), I am still not satiated with its charms, 
#tr.en: the game with it has not yet palled for me! 
#tr.en: If only my ball (?) waited still in the carpenter’s house for me! 
#tr.en: I would treat the carpenter’s wife like my own mother— 
#tr.en: I would treat the carpenter’s child like my little sister! 
#tr.en: My ball (?) has fallen down to the nether world—who will retrieve it for me? 
#tr.en: My mallet (?) has fallen down to Ganzer—who will retrieve it for me? 
#tr.en: His servant Enkidu answered: 
#tr.en: “My king, you weep; why does your heart worry? 
#tr.en: Today I shall retrieve your ball (?) from the nether world, 
#tr.en: I shall retrieve your mallet (?) from Ganzer.” 
#tr.en: Gilgamesh answered Enkidu: 
#tr.en: “If today you are going to go down to the nether world, 
#tr.en: let me advise you! My instructions should be followed. 
#tr.en: Let me talk to you! Pay attention to my words!" 
#tr.en: “You should not put on your clean garments: 
#tr.en: they would recognise immediately that you are alien. 
#tr.en: You should not anoint yourself with fine oil from a bowl: 
#tr.en: they would surround you at its scent. 
#tr.en: You should not hurl throw-sticks in the nether world: 
#tr.en: those struck down by the throw-sticks would surround you. 
#tr.en: You should not not hold a cornel-wood stick in your hand: 
#tr.en: the spirits would feel insulted by you. 
#tr.en: You should not put sandals on your feet. 
#tr.en: You should not shout in the nether world. 
#tr.en: You should not kiss your beloved wife. 
#tr.en: You should not hit your wife even if you are annoyed with her. 
#tr.en: You should not kiss your beloved child. 
#tr.en: You should not hit your son even if you are annoyed with him. 
#tr.en: The outcry aroused would detain you in the nether world.” 
#tr.en: “She who lies there, she who lies there, 
#tr.en: Ninazu’s mother who lies there— 
#tr.en: her pure shoulders are not covered with a garment, 
#tr.en: and no linen is spread over her pure breast. 
#tr.en: She has fingers like a pickaxe, 
#tr.en: she plucks her hair out like leeks.” 
#tr.en: Enkidu, however, did not heed not his master’s words. 
#tr.en: He put on his clean garments 
#tr.en: and they recognised that he was alien. 
#tr.en: He anointed himself with fine oil from a bowl 
#tr.en: and they surrounded him at its scent. 
#tr.en: He hurled throw-sticks in the nether world 
#tr.en: and those struck down by the throw-sticks surrounded him. 
#tr.en: He held a cornel-wood stick in his hand 
#tr.en: and the spirits felt insulted by him. 
#tr.en: He put sandals on his feet. 
#tr.en: He caused irritation in the nether world. 
#tr.en: He kissed his beloved wife 
#tr.en: and hit his wife when he was annoyed with her. 
#tr.en: He kissed his beloved child 
#tr.en: and hit his son when he was annoyed with him. 
#tr.en: He aroused an outcry and was detained in the nether world. 
#tr.en: The warrior Gilgamesh, son of Ninsumun, 
#tr.en: directed his steps on his own to E-kur, the temple of Enlil. 
#tr.en: He cried before Enlil: 
#tr.en: “Father Enlil, my ball (?) fell down into the nether world, my mallet (?) fell down into Ganzer. 
#tr.en: Enkidu went down to retrieve them but the nether world has seized him. 
#tr.en: Namtar did not seize him, the Asag did not seize him; but the nether world has seized him. 
#tr.en: The udug demon of Nergal, who spares nobody, did not seize him, but the nether world has seized him. 
#tr.en: He did not fall in battle on the field of manhood, but the nether world has seized him.” 
#tr.en: Father Enlil did not stand by him in the matter, so he went to Eridu. 
#tr.en: In Eridu he directed his steps on his own to the temple of Enki. 
#tr.en: He cried before Enki: 
#tr.en: “Father Enki, my ball (?) fell down into the nether world, my mallet (?) fell down into Ganzer. 
#tr.en: Enkidu went down to retrieve them but the nether world has seized him. 
#tr.en: Namtar did not seize him, the Asag did not seize him; but the nether world has seized him. 
#tr.en: The udug demon of Nergal, who spares nobody, did not seize him, but the nether world has seized him. 
#tr.en: He did not fall in battle on the field of manhood, but the nether world has seized him.” 
#tr.en: Father Enki stood by him in this matter. 
#tr.en: He said to the young warrior Utu, the son born by Ningal:

#tr.en: I (am) Darius, the great king, king of kings, king in Persia, king of nations, Hystaspes, his son, Arsames, his the grandson, an Achaemenid. 
#tr.en: And Darius the king says: I, my father (was) Hystaspes, and Hystaspes, his father (was) Arsames, and Arsames, his father (was) Ariaramnes, and Ariaramnes, his father (was) Teispes, and Teispes, his father (was) Achaemenes. 
#tr.en: And Darius the king says: For that reason we call (our) family Achaemenids. From long ago (we) have been noble and from long ago our family has been kings. 
#tr.en: And Darius the king says: 8 kings in my family formerly held kingship. I held the 9th kingship. One after the other, we were kings. 
#tr.en: And Darius the king says: (By) the intercession of Ahuramazda, I performed the kingship. Ahuramazda gave me the kingship. 
#tr.en: And Darius the king says: These (are) the nations who called (themselves) mine (and by) the intercession of Ahuramazda, I placed the kingship over them: The Persians and the Elamites and the Babylonians and the Assyrians and the Arabians and the Egyptians and the Sea-People and the Sardians and the Ionians and the Medes and the Armenians and the Cappadocians and the Parthians and the Drangians and the Areians and the Chorasmians and Bactria and the Sogdians and Parauparisana(?) and the Scythians and Sattagydia and Arachosia and Maka, a grand(?) total (of) 23 nations. 
#tr.en: And Darius the king says: These nations who call (themselves) mine, (by) the intercession of Ahuramazda, performed service unto me, brought me tribute, (and) whatever I commanded, night and day, they accomplished. 
#tr.en: And Darius the king says: Throughout these nations, the man who(?) was(?) …, him (I) upheld; whoever injured, him greatly (I) investigated. (By) the intercession of Ahuramazda, my law was upheld throughout these nations; whatever I commanded, that they accomplished. 
#tr.en: And Darius the king says: Ahuramazda gave me this kingship and Ahuramazda sent me aid, until I strengthened this kingship, and (by) the intercession of Ahuramazda, I held kingship. 
#tr.en: And Darius the king says: This is what I did (by) the intercession of Ahuramazda, after (I) received the kingship. Cambyses by name, Cyrus, his son, of our family, formerly(?) held kingship. That Cambyses, his brother was Smerdis by name, and (Cambyses from) mother (and) father was together with him and that Cambyses killed Smerdis. When Cambyses killed Smerdis the people didn’t know that Smerdis was dead. Then Cambyses went to Egypt. Then the people caused destruction; furthermore, the lies grew throughout the nations, both in Persia and in Media, and throughout other nations. And then, a man, a Magus Gaumata by name, he, from Naširma, a mountain, Harakkatarriš by name, from there 14 days of month Mikannaš had passed, thus (he) rose up. He lied to the people: I am Smerdis, Cyrus the son, Cambyses the brother. Then all the people rebelled against Cambyses and went (over) to him, both the Persians and the Medes and the other nations and(?) he held kingship. 9 days of month Karmabataš had passed, thus (the kingship) was seized(?) from Cambyses. And then Cambyses died of natural causes. 
#tr.en: And Darius the king says: This kingship that Gaumata the Magus took away from Cambyses, this kingship for a long time belonged to our family. Accordingly, Gaumata the Magus took it away from Cambyses, both the Persians and the Medes and the other nations, he took them away from him and made (them) his possessions. He held kingship. 
#tr.en: And Darius the king says: There was no man, no-one(?), not a Persian or a Mede or (anyone) from our family, who received the kingship from Gaumata the Magus. The people greatly feared him. (He) slaughtered the people, (those) who formerly knew Smerdis. For that reason (he) slaughtered the people: lest (they) know me that I am not Smerdis, Cyrus, his son and no-one (with) anything related to Gaumata Magus came forth, until I came. After that I prayed to Ahuramazda. Ahuramazda sent me aid. (By) the intercession of Ahuramazda, 10 days of month Bakeyatiš had passed, thus with a few men I killed Gaumata Magus and his accompanying men, his foremost followers, in a fortress, Shikkaumatiš by name, (in) Nušaya by name, a district in Media, there I killed him and I took away his kingship. (By) the intercession of Ahuramazda, I held kingship. Ahuramazda gave me the kingship. 
#tr.en: And Darius the king says: The kingship that had been taken away from our family, that I brought back and I set in its place as it was formerly. Accordingly, and(?) I made the temple(s) of the gods that Gaumata the Magus had destroyed, and I restored to the people, to them, pasture lands(?) and herds and workers and the houses, as seized(?) (by people) that Gaumata the Magus had taken away from them, and I place the people in their places, both the Persians and the Medes and the other nations, and(?) accordingly as it was formerly. I, what had been taken away, that brought back. (By) the intercession of Ahuramazda, this I made. I exerted effort until (I) restored our house as it was formerly and I exerted effort, (by) the intercession of Ahuramazda, that Gaumata the Magus hadn’t taken away our house. 
#tr.en: This is what was accomplished by me as formerly (I) held kingship. 
#tr.en: And Darius the king says: When I killed Gaumata the Magus, then Hašina by name, an Elamite, Ukbatarranma, his son, rose up in the Elamites’ (land and he) said: I held kingship of the Elamites. Then the Elamites rebelled against me and went (over) to that Hašina. Then he held kingship of the Elamites and both, one man Nidintu-Bēl by name, a Babylonian, Ḫanara, his son, he rose up in Babylon and (to) the people, thus, to them lied (and) said: I (am) Nebuchadnezzar, son of Nabonidus. Then all the Babylonian people went (over) to that Nidintu-Bēl. Then the Babylonians rebelled. He held kingship of the Babylonians. 
#tr.en: And Darius the king says: Then I sent a messenger to Elam that Hašina was seized and in shackles (he) was brought back to me. Then I killed him. 
#tr.en: And Darius the king says: Then I went to Babylon, to that Nidintu-Bēl, who said: I (am) Nebuchadnezzar. The troops of that Nidintu-Bēl, at the river Tigris by name, there, were deployed(?). (They) sized the bank(?) of the Tigris and that river was navigable. Then I supplied the troops with leather-skins; (another) remaining part, (I) placed them on camels, (for another) remaining part, on horses was placed. Ahuramazda sent me aid. (By) the intercession of Ahuramazda, (we) went across the Tigris there, (I) killed the troops of that Nidintu-Bēl. 26 days of month Hashiyatiyasš had passed, thus (we) made battle. (I) killed many of his(?) troops there. 
#tr.en: And Darius the king says: then I went to Babylon. Before I arrived in Babylon, a town, Zazzan by name, situated on the Euphrates, there that Nidintu-Bēl, who said: Nebuchadnezzar attacked me together with troops in battle. Then (we) made battle. Ahuramazda sent me aid. (By) intercession of Ahuramazda, (I) killed the troops of that Nidintu-Bēl there. 2 days of month Hanamakaš had passed, thus we made battle. I slaughtered the troops of Nidintu-Bēl, and (others) who were fleeing to the river were carried away by this river. 
#tr.en: And Darius the king says: Then that Nidintu-Bēl together with several horsemen fled and went to Babylon. Then I went forth to Babylon and (by) the intercession of Ahuramazda, (I) seized Babylon and that Nidintu-Bēl. Then I killed that Nidintu-Bēl in Babylon. 
#tr.en: And Darius the king says: While I was in Babylon these nations rebelled against me: The Persians and the Elamites and the Medes and the Assyrians and the Egyptians and the Parthians and the Margians and Sattagydia and the Scythians. 
#tr.en: And Darius the king says: One man, Martiya by name, Zinzakriš, his son, a town, Kukkannakan by name, in Persia, dwelt. He rose up in Elam and the people thus to them (he) said: I (am) Ummannuš, king of the Elamites, and at that time I was near Elam. Afterwards, the Elamites feared me; (they) seized that Martiya who called himself their chief, and killed him. 
#tr.en: And Darius the king says: One man, Phraortes by name, rose up in Media,  thus to the people said: I am Šattarrida of the family of Cyaxares. Then the Mede troops who were in the palace rebelled against me (and) went (over) to him. (He) held kingship in Media. The Persian and the Median troops with me were few. Then I sent forth the troops to Media. Hydarnes by name, a Persian, my servant, I made their chief, thus I said to them: Go forth! The Median troops who do not call themselves mine, kill them! Then Hydarnes together with the troops went off to the Media. When he went to Media, in the town, Maruš by name, in Media, there (he) did battle. (He) who was chief among the Medes wasn't present at that time. Ahuramazda sent me aid. (By) the intercession of Ahuramazda, my troops slaughtered the rebellious troops. 27 days of the month Hanamakaš had passed, thus (they) did battle. Then my troops did not accomplished anything. (In a) district, Kampantaš by name, in Media, there he awaited for me until I came to Media. 
#tr.en: And Darius the king says: Daturšiš by name, an Armenian, my servant, I sent to the Armenia, thus I said to him: Go forth!

#tr.en: I would praise the lord of wisdom, the circumspect god, 
#tr.en: who rages at night, reconciling by day; 
#tr.en: Marduk, lord of wisdom, circumspect god, 
#tr.en: who rages at night, reconciling by day; 
#tr.en: who like a storm, a whilrwind, causes desolation his rage, 
#tr.en: and (then) as a breeze of the morning, his breath sweet; 
#tr.en: in his anger unapproachable, a flood his fury; 
#tr.en: attentive his mind, his liver is merciful; 
#tr.en: the n. of whose hand cannot bear the heavens, 
#tr.en: whose tender hand holds back the dead; 
#tr.en: Marduk, the n. of whose hand cannot bear the heavens, 
#tr.en: whose tender hand holds back the dead; 
#tr.en: through whose rage are opened the graves, 
#tr.en: then from disaster he raised the fallen; 
#tr.en: he frowns, do exit the guardian and protective spirit, 
#tr.en: he looks on, and to the one whom he pushed away, his god turns; 
#tr.en: where momentarily his overbearing punishment is heavy, 
#tr.en: yet he showed pity, and turns into his own mother, 
#tr.en: He becomes pointed, and his inner wild bull butts, 
#tr.en: then like a cow to calf, he constantly turns round to his back; 
#tr.en: stinging are his beatings, piercing the body, 
#tr.en: cooling his bandages, reviving the deceased; 
#tr.en: he speaks, and sin spreads, 
#tr.en: yet on the day of his prosperity, excused are obligation and guilt; 
#tr.en: he is it who utukku and tremors lets have, 
#tr.en: yet his spell drives away frost and chills; 
#tr.en: who multiplies the flooding of Adad, the blows of Erra, 
#tr.en: yet who placates the angry god and goddess; 
#tr.en: the lord the entire stomach of the gods inspects, 
#tr.en: and no one among the gods his path knows, 
#tr.en: Marduk the entire stomach of the gods inspects, 
#tr.en: but no god comes to understand his mind; 
#tr.en: as heavy his hand, so his stomach merciful, 
#tr.en: as cruel his weapons, so his liver revives; 
#tr.en: absent his stomach, who his blows would pacify? 
#tr.en: Without his weightiness, who would causes to hang his hands? 
#tr.en: I would glorify his wrath, as one who like fish ate mud, 
#tr.en: he penalized as quickly as he revives the dead; 
#tr.en: how near is their salvation,

#tr.en: rejects me my god, up his mountain went, 
#tr.en: ceased my goddess, went to the foriegn region, 
#tr.en: split away the good šēdu-spirit of my side, 
#tr.en: fearful was my lamassu-spirit, a second one sought out, 
#tr.en: taken away was my strength, my manliness darkened; 
#tr.en: my essence flew off, onto the roof jumped, 
#tr.en: established for me were the signs of terror, 
#tr.en: expelled from my house, outside I wandered; 
#tr.en: confused were my omens, swollen all day, 
#tr.en: with diviner and dream interpreter, my path is not distinct; 
#tr.en: in the entry of the street, ominous my oracular expressions, 
#tr.en: I lay down in the second watch, and my dream was frightening: 
#tr.en: the king, flesh of the gods, sun of his people, 
#tr.en: his stomach was knotted up, and he was making its loosening very difficult, 
#tr.en: the administrators slander let constantly fly against me, 
#tr.en: gathered themselves, and made stick maliciousness. 
#tr.en: If the first one: ‟His life I'll make him pour out,” 
#tr.en: is saying the second, “I’ll raise (him) up from his post;” 
#tr.en: who like the third, “his appointment I will seize." 
#tr.en: “I will enter in his house,” the fourth swears 
#tr.en: the fifth: “the mouth of the lung was turned over,” 
#tr.en: the sixth and seventh follow in his šēdu-spirit. 
#tr.en: They joined up against me, the band of seven, their gang; 
#tr.en: like a storm without mercy, evil demons matching, 
#tr.en: and one was their flesh, and each by (word of) mouth making known, 
#tr.en: raging against me, burning like a fire, 
#tr.en: malicious talk and obstruction they cause to join forces against me, 
#tr.en: my noble mouth as with a bridle they bound, 
#tr.en: my lips that were in constant motion became as to a deaf man; 
#tr.en: my loud roar escaped into silence; 
#tr.en: my high head bowed to the ground; 
#tr.en: my fulsome stomach the horror weakened; 
#tr.en: my broad chest, into (that of) a small man changed; 
#tr.en: my far-reaching arms were bound together; 
#tr.en: I who as a lord was walking, to crawl I learned; 
#tr.en: I was such a one as was prideful, but I turned into a slave; 
#tr.en: (born) to an extended family, I became a loner; 
#tr.en: the street I am traversing, and stretched out are fingers; 
#tr.en: I enter to the palace, and in fast movement are the eyes; 
#tr.en: my city, like an enemy, is looking at me with an evil eye. 
#tr.en: It was as a furious enemy, my land; 
#tr.en: into a stranger my brother turned; 
#tr.en: into an evil one and a gallê-demon has turned my friend; 
#tr.en: an enraged companion denounces me; 
#tr.en: my colleague always dirties the weapon; 
#tr.en: my sweet friend cuts off my life; 
#tr.en: openly in an assembly cursed me my male slave; 
#tr.en: my female slave before gatherings slander against me spoke; 
#tr.en: an acquaintance saw me, and he leaned in to the the corner; 
#tr.en: as one not of its flesh established me my family; 
#tr.en: for who spoke of my goodness, opened up for him a tomb; 
#tr.en: who swore to my slander was moved to the head; 
#tr.en: who pronounced my defamation, a god was his aid; 
#tr.en: to the one who said “Mercy!,” quickly to him came death; 
#tr.en: who was not hesitant, swore health his šēdu (spirit); 
#tr.en: I had no-one at my side, mercy I did not experience; 
#tr.en: to the bands and thugs they distributed all that I own; 
#tr.en: the mouth of my river they measured out with silt; 
#tr.en: from my farmlands they sent out the work song; 
#tr.en: like the city of an enemy, they let grow silent my city; 
#tr.en: my offices they let take another; 
#tr.en: and to my cultic duties a stranger they stationed. 
#tr.en: A day of weariness, a night of wailing; 
#tr.en: a month of anxious silence, misery the year; 
#tr.en: like a dove I mourn all my days, 
#tr.en: singers my lamentation make loud; 
#tr.en: in constant weaping were caused to see my eyes; 
#tr.en: fifty times over, in tears burned my cheeks; 
#tr.en: blackened my face the darkness of my stomach; 
#tr.en: my skin turned yellow did terror and panic, 
#tr.en: the ‘sources’ of my stomach in constant panic trembled, 
#tr.en: it burned like a thousand suns, 
#tr.en: like a flame blazing turned my supplication; 
#tr.en: like strife and brawl was my prayer, 
#tr.en: I sweetened my lips, like a lance stiff, 
#tr.en: like salt I swore, a bolt is my interpreter; 
#tr.en: I hope, at daybreak comes a good thing to me; 
#tr.en: the moon becomes visible, shines my sun. 
#tr.en: I survived to the next year; the appointed time passed. 
#tr.en: As I turn round, it is terrible, it is so terrible; 
#tr.en: My ill luck has increased, and I do not find the right. 
#tr.en: I called to my god, but he did not show his face, 
#tr.en: I prayed to my goddess, but she did not raise her head. 
#tr.en: The diviner with his inspection has not got to the root of the matter, 
#tr.en: nor with a libation has the dream interpreter elucidated my case. 
#tr.en: I sought the favor of the zaqzīqu-spirit, but he did not enlighten me; 
#tr.en: And the incantation priest with his ritual did not appease the divine wrath against me. 
#tr.en: What strange conditions everywhere! 
#tr.en: When I look behind, there is persecution, trouble. 
#tr.en: Like one who has not made libations to his god, 
#tr.en: Nor invoked his goddess at table, 
#tr.en: Does not engage in prostration, nor takes cognizance of bowing down; 
#tr.en: From whose mouth supplication and prayer is lacking, 
#tr.en: Who has done nothing on holy days, and despised sabbaths, 
#tr.en: Who in his negligence has despised the gods’ rites, 
#tr.en: Has not taught his people reverence and worship, 
#tr.en: But has eaten his food without invoking his god, 
#tr.en: And abandoned his goddess by not bringing a flour offering, 
#tr.en: Like one who has grown torpid and forgotten his lord, 
#tr.en: Has frivolously sworn a solemn oath by his god, (like such an one) do I appear. 
#tr.en: For myself, I gave attention to supplication and prayer: 
#tr.en: To me prayer was discretion, sacrifice my rule. 
#tr.en: The day for reverencing the god was a joy to my heart; 
#tr.en: The day of the goddess’s procession was profit and gain to me. 
#tr.en: The king’s prayer-that was my joy, 
#tr.en: And the accompanying music became a delight for me. 
#tr.en: I instructed my land to keep the god’s rites, 
#tr.en: And provoked my people to value the goddess’s name. 
#tr.en: I made praise for the king like a god’s, 
#tr.en: And taught the populace reverence for the palace. 
#tr.en: I wish I knew that these things were pleasing to one’s god! 
#tr.en: What is proper to oneself is an offence to one’s god, 
#tr.en: What in one’s own heart seems despicable is proper to one’s god, 
#tr.en: Who knows the will of the gods in heaven? 
#tr.en: Who understands the plans of the underworld gods? 
#tr.en: Where have mortals learnt the way of a god? 
#tr.en: He who was alive yesterday is dead today. 
#tr.en: For a minute he was dejected, suddenly he is exuberant, 
#tr.en: One moment people are singing in exaltation, 
#tr.en: Another they groan like professional mourners. 
#tr.en: Their condition changes like opening and shutting (the legs). 
#tr.en: When starving they become like corpses, 
#tr.en: When replete they vie with their gods. 
#tr.en: In prosperity they speak of scaling heaven, 
#tr.en: Under adversity they complain of going down to hell. 
#tr.en: I am appalled at these things; I do not understand their significance. 
#tr.en: As for me, the exhausted one, a tempest is driving me! 
#tr.en: Debilitating Disease is let loose upon me: 
#tr.en: An Evil Wind has blown from the horizon, 
#tr.en: Headache has sprung up from the surface of the underworld, 
#tr.en: An Evil Cough has left its Apsu, 
#tr.en: The irresistible Ghost left Ekur, 
#tr.en: The Lamastu-demon came down from the Mountain, 
#tr.en: Cramp set out from ... the flood, 
#tr.en: Impotence cleaves the ground along with the grass. 
#tr.en: ... their host, fogether they came on me. 
#tr.en: ... head, they enveloped my skull; 
#tr.en: My face is gloomy, my eyes are in flood. 
#tr.en: They have wrenched my neck muscles and taken the strength from my neck. 
#tr.en: They struck my chest, drubbing my breast. 
#tr.en: They affected my flesh and caused convulsions, 
#tr.en: In my epigastrium they kindled a fire. 
#tr.en: They upset my bowels ... . 
#tr.en: Causing the discharge of phlegm, they brought on a fever in my lungs. 
#tr.en: They caused fever in my limbs and made my fat quake. 
#tr.en: My lofty stature they destroyed like a wall, 
#tr.en: My robust figure they laid down like a bulrush, 
#tr.en: I am thrown down like a bog plant and cast on my face. 
#tr.en: The alu-demon has clothed himself in my body as with a garment; 
#tr.en: Sleep covers me like a net. 
#tr.en: My eyes stare, but do not see, 
#tr.en: My ears are open, but do not hear. 
#tr.en: Feebleness has seized my whole body, 
#tr.en: Concussion has fallen upon my flesh. 
#tr.en: Paralysis has grasped my arms, 
#tr.en: Impotence has fallen on my knees, 
#tr.en: My feet forget their motion. 
#tr.en: A stroke has got me; I choke like someone prostrate. 
#tr.en: ... death, it has covered my face. 
#tr.en: The dream priest mentions me, but I do not respond. 
#tr.en: ... weep, but I have no control of my faculties. 
#tr.en: A snare is . laid on my mouth, 
#tr.en: And a bolt bars my lips. 
#tr.en: My ’gate’ is barred, my ’drinking place’ blocked, 
#tr.en: My hunger is prolonged, my throat stopped up. 
#tr.en: When grain is served, I eat it like stinkweed, 
#tr.en: Beer, the life of mankind, is distasteful to me. 
#tr.en: My malady is indeed protracted. 
#tr.en: Through lack of food my countenance is changed, 
#tr.en: My flesh is flaccid, and my blood has ebbed away. 
#tr.en: My bones have corne apart, and are covered (only) with my skin. 
#tr.en: My tissues are inflamed, and have caught the ...-disease. 
#tr.en: I take to a bed of bondage; going out is a pain; 
#tr.en: My house has become my prison. 
#tr.en: My arms are stricken-which shackles my flesh; 
#tr.en: My feet are limp-which fetters my person. 
#tr.en: My afflictions are grievous, my wound is severe. 
#tr.en: A scourge has thrown me down, the stroke is intense. 
#tr.en: The crop pierces me and the spur is severe. 
#tr.en: All day long the tormentor torments me, 
#tr.en: Nor at night does he let me relax for a minute. 
#tr.en: Through twisting my sinews are parted, 
#tr.en: My limbs are splayed and knocked apart. 
#tr.en: I spend the night in my dung like an ox, 
#tr.en: And wallow in my excrement like a sheep. 
#tr.en: My complaints have exposed the incantation priest, 
#tr.en: And my omens have confounded the diviner. 
#tr.en: The exorcist has not diagnosed the nature of my complaint, 
#tr.en: Nor has the diviner put a time limit on my illness. 
#tr.en: My god has not come to the rescue in taking me by the hand, 
#tr.en: Nor has my goddess shown pity on me by going at my side. 
#tr.en: My grave was waiting, and my funerary paraphernalia ready, 
#tr.en: Before I had died lamentation for me was finished. 
#tr.en: All my country said, “How he is crushed!” 
#tr.en: The face of him who gloats lit up when he heard, 
#tr.en: The tidings reached her who gloats, and her heart rejoiced. 
#tr.en: But I know the day for my whole family, 
#tr.en: When, among my friends, their Sun will have mercy. 
#tr.en: Heavy his hand, I was not able to bear it, 
#tr.en: frightening was his fearsomeness ... 
#tr.en: his punishment fiece was a flood, and ... 
#tr.en: arduous was his way, ... 
#tr.en: the severe disease was heavy. My self not ... 
#tr.en: of my wakefullness I was forgetful; they make me wander ... 
#tr.en: day and night alike I was wailing; 
#tr.en: dream, daydream equally are insufferable for me, 
#tr.en: one young man, superior in form, 
#tr.en: in physique prideful, in clothing renewed, 
#tr.en: because in dreaming his sides of form were deprived, 
#tr.en: in fearsome radiance he was covered, clothed in fear, 
#tr.en: he entered and stood over me. 
#tr.en: I saw him, paralyzed my flesh, 
#tr.en: and he said, “Your lord sent me.” 
#tr.en: ... he stood, sickening ... 
#tr.en: “Gather, and I will speak of their thoughts, 
#tr.en: they whom the king who sent, the people 
#tr.en: grew silent; no one answered me, 
#tr.en: those who heard me I was observing, and 
#tr.en: A second time, a dream I see, 
#tr.en: in the dream that I saw at night, 
#tr.en: one cleansing priest carrying a water basin 
#tr.en: a tamarisk purifying grasped in his hand: 
#tr.en: “Laluralimma, sorceress of Nippur, 
#tr.en: to purify you sent me.” 
#tr.en: water that he carried over me he poured, 
#tr.en: the spell of life he cast rubbed on my body. 
#tr.en: A third time, a dream I see, 
#tr.en: in the dream that I saw at night, 
#tr.en: one maid, beautiful her countenance, 
#tr.en: like people dressed, (but) a god equal, 
#tr.en: a queen of the people ... 
#tr.en: she entered, and sat at my side, 
#tr.en: saying, “Enough! Greatly he was distressed. 
#tr.en: Do not fear!” She said to me and made firm my stomach. 
#tr.en: and in whatever dream he saw, ... 
#tr.en: and she said, “Enough! Greatly he was distressed.” 
#tr.en: anyone who in the second watch of the night witnessed a vision. 
#tr.en: In the dream Ur-Nintinuga I see, 
#tr.en: a bearded young man, bearing his crown, 
#tr.en: an incanttion priest carrying a writing board: 
#tr.en: “Marduk sent me, 
#tr.en: In his pure hands, he brought a bandage, 
#tr.en: for my personal assistant into his hand he entrusted, 
#tr.en: in the dream he sent the message, 
#tr.en: his favorable sign to my people he revealed, 
#tr.en: from sickness the snake coiled had stolen away, 
#tr.en: my illness suddenly was passed, broken my cuffs, 
#tr.en: since my lord’s stomach has calmed, 
#tr.en: of merciful Marduk his liver released, 
#tr.en: he took my petition, the requests ... 
#tr.en: his good attention he uncovered ..., 
#tr.en: saying, “Enough! Greatly is he troubled.” 
#tr.en: his ... to proclaim ... 
#tr.en: ... to labor and ... 
#tr.en: ... the sin ... 
#tr.en: ... divine punishment ... 
#tr.en: ... my guilt ... 
#tr.en: my transgressions he let carry off the wind, 
#tr.en: ... 
#tr.en: ... 
#tr.en: ... 
#tr.en: ... 
#tr.en: ... 
#tr.en: ... like ... 
#tr.en: He has brought near his spell instead of cough, 
#tr.en: he has driven away Evil Wind to the horizon; 
#tr.en: to the edge of the netherworld, he took away the dī’u(-disease), 
#tr.en: he has sent down to its Deep the evil cough; 
#tr.en: the irresistible utukku he sent back to Ekur, 
#tr.en: he overwhelmed Lamaštu, to the mountain he let her climb up; 
#tr.en: the crowns of the seas the chill he made take away, 
#tr.en: the base of debility he tore out like grass; 
#tr.en: my bad sleep, poured out restfulness, 
#tr.en: like smoke that filled the heavens he sent off; 
#tr.en: woe and grief, pushing and shaking, 
#tr.en: he made rise like a fog and made descend to the netherworld; 
#tr.en: persistent headache, like a grinding-stone heavy, 
#tr.en: he lifted like dew of the night, from me he removed; 
#tr.en: my afflicted eyes that were covered with the pall of the death, 
#tr.en: he made rise a multitude of double-hours; he made bright my vision; 
#tr.en: from my ears that were clogged and blocked like those of a deaf person, 
#tr.en: he took away their obstruction, he opened my hearing; 
#tr.en: my nose that in pursuit of fever was stopped its breathing, 
#tr.en: he soothed its affliction and I breathed immediately; 
#tr.en: from my lips, that were raging and taking harsh words, 
#tr.en: he wiped away their terror and loosened their knot; 
#tr.en: my mouth, that was covered and for speaking stiff, 
#tr.en: he polished like a qû-(jar), its filth he wiped away; 
#tr.en: my teeth, caught and as one bound, 
#tr.en: he opened their restraints and their roots let speak; 
#tr.en: the tongue, bound and to wag unable, 
#tr.en: its fatty coating he cleared and sharp was my speech; 
#tr.en: for the windpipe, shut up and stopped as with a lump, 
#tr.en: he relieved the chest that like a reed pipe he let sing; 
#tr.en: the larynx, blocked up and unable to get air, 
#tr.en: its scales he sent straight off and its blockage opened; 
#tr.en: ... of mine are high, its rain ... 
#tr.en: ... piled-up high, he pours on ... 
#tr.en: ... veiled like being buried, ... 
#tr.en: his ..., a song .... 
#tr.en: The large intestine, in hunger raised, like a basket joined together, 
#tr.en: ... water, its meadow, ... 
#tr.en: it shall receive meal, it shall bring the drink. 
#tr.en: ... I flourished ... 
#tr.en: xxx 
#tr.en: ... 
#tr.en: ... 
#tr.en: My neck, whose roots become loose and bent down, 
#tr.en: he made strong the mountain and like a fir-tree fixed it upright; 
#tr.en: to that of a wrestler my physical power he made equal; 
#tr.en: like a boil taking out, he trimmed my finger-nails; 
#tr.en: he drove out their fatigue, their filth made good; 
#tr.en: Like a tower ..., 
#tr.en: inside ... 
#tr.en: My knees, bound and like a partridge cramped, 
#tr.en: he has made the legs straight like ... 
#tr.en: my feet that lay wasted ..., 
#tr.en: my strength taken away ...; 
#tr.en: the form of my body widened ...; 
#tr.en: my limbs ...; 
#tr.en: body, my limbs, ...; 
#tr.en: clad like ... 
#tr.en: the discharge of ... 
#tr.en: he wiped off frost, its filth cleared; 
#tr.en: manliness flickering is flashing, 
#tr.en: on the bank of River, where judgment of people is determined, 
#tr.en: ... of ... 
#tr.en: ... gods ... 
#tr.en: ... goddesses penalties ... 
#tr.en: ... they placed them, utterance ... 
#tr.en: ... both ... 
#tr.en: ... I have been tormented ... 
#tr.en: ... with him, healing is established, ... 
#tr.en: ... he healed me, his punishment ...; 
#tr.en: on the forehead I was struck, from slavery I was released. 
#tr.en: ... like a lion(?) ... 
#tr.en: ... snake ... 
#tr.en: ... bent over ... 
#tr.en: ... in Esagil a šigû I recited; 
#tr.en: ... of mine, the šigû ... 
#tr.en: Kunuš-kadru street in freedom I was traversing, 
#tr.en: ... 
#tr.en: Zarpanītu I trust(?) ... 
#tr.en: my god I trust(?) ... 
#tr.en: my goddess I trust(?) ... 
#tr.en: who does not fear his god ... 
#tr.en: who does not fear his goddess ... 
#tr.en: who to Esagil is negligent my example shall see, 
#tr.en: who to Babylon ... 
#tr.en: painful deeds ... 
#tr.en: morning ... 
#tr.en: ... 
#tr.en: My lord relieved me, 
#tr.en: my lord bandaged me; 
#tr.en: my lord released me; 
#tr.en: my lord healed me; 
#tr.en: from the pit he took me away; 
#tr.en: up from the grave dug me; 
#tr.en: from the annihilation raised me; 
#tr.en: from the Ḫubur-river pulled me; 
#tr.en: in the adversity my hand held; 
#tr.en: from the right side struck me, 
#tr.en: from the left side, held high my head; 
#tr.en: struck the hands of my beater, 
#tr.en: made fall his weapon did Marduk; 
#tr.en: in the mouth of the lion devouring me 
#tr.en: put a muzzle did Marduk; 
#tr.en: Marduk, that of my capturer, 
#tr.en: took away his sling, his sling-stone turned away; 
#tr.en: from the hand of my burier the spade he took away; 
#tr.en: from the hands of my male wailer made fall the harp?; 
#tr.en: the mouth of the female wailer from wailing stopped; 
#tr.en: the mouth of my ill-wisher with woe filled; 
#tr.en: the mouth of my lady ill-wisher ... 
#tr.en: he cast a mourning-ritual ...; 
#tr.en: ... 
#tr.en: ... 
#tr.en: to the city square ... he will take me; 
#tr.en: to the presence of ... let me enter; 
#tr.en: my ill-wisher who ... destroyed? did Marduk, 
#tr.en: my lady ill-wisher who ..., held back did Ṣarpanītu. 
#tr.en: Who might it be? The lord released me! 
#tr.en: let life quickly come to an end! 
#tr.en: to the netherworld I am descending! 
#tr.en: in ghostliness I am wandering around! 
#tr.en: Who might it be? Marduk spared me. 
#tr.en: to the body of the asakku I am counted; 
#tr.en: a corpse I am wandering around, yes! 
#tr.en: In a full mēsū have they purified me. 
#tr.en: the bathing ritual, the restoration of aged they repeatedly performed; 
#tr.en: he swore that in the supplication he heard ... 
#tr.en: for brick-of-nose and prayer, to esagil I went up, 
#tr.en: having come down and returned from the grave, through Bāb-erēb-Šamši I entered; 
#tr.en: at Bāb-ḫegalli abundance was given me, 
#tr.en: at Bāb-Lamassu my spirit approached me; 
#tr.en: at Bāb-šulmi well-being I saw;

#tr.en: at Bāb-ṣīt-Šamši among the living I was counted; 
#tr.en: at Bāb-tabrīti my signs became bright; 
#tr.en: at Bāb-paṭār-arni my penalty was cleared; 
#tr.en: at Bāb-dalīli they questioned my mouth; 
#tr.en: at Bāb-paṭār my distress was released; 
#tr.en: at Bāb-mê-ellīti with purification water I was sprinkled; 
#tr.en: at Bāb-šulmi Marduk I met; 
#tr.en: at Bāb-râši the foot of Ṣarpanītu I kissed; 
#tr.en: while entreaty and devotions before them I was offering, 
#tr.en: fragrant incense before them I burnt; 
#tr.en: I presented donations, gifts, presents laid against each other; 
#tr.en: I slaughtered a fat bull, I butchered high-quality sheep; 
#tr.en: I have repeatedly made libation of syrup beer (and) pure wine; 
#tr.en: (of) the šēdu (and) lamassu, the (divine) attendants, the brickwork of Esagil, 
#tr.en: with libation, their liver I made glow, 
#tr.en: with exceeding meal, I made their stomach rejoice; 
#tr.en: the door jamb, the bolt, the bar of the doors, 
#tr.en: I drenched (with) sesame oil, ghee, and abundance of grain; 
#tr.en: ... the experts? of the ordinance of the cult; 
#tr.en: beer of red grain I gave them to drink; 
#tr.en: I repeatedly sprinkled sweet cypress-oil on them ... 
#tr.en: The banquets, the Babylonian, ... 
#tr.en: “the house of his burial” they performed during the banquets; 
#tr.en: theye saw, the Babylonians, how they could revive his servant, 
#tr.en: all the districts proclaimed their greatness: 
#tr.en: “Who spoke of seeing his sun? 
#tr.en: In the stomach of whom arose, traversing the his street? 
#tr.en: Other than Marduk who his dead ones revived? 
#tr.en: For Ṣarpanītu which goddess expect granted his life? 
#tr.en: Marduk in the grabe can revive. 
#tr.en: Ṣarpanītu from annihilation to save sees. 
#tr.en: Wherever is laid the land and is stretched out the heaven, 
#tr.en: the sun shines and the fire is lit, 
#tr.en: water flows, blows the wind, 
#tr.en: those whose clay aruru pinched off, 
#tr.en: the living creatures that open the legs, 
#tr.en: the people, as many as exist, Marduk praise!” 
#tr.en: ... those that (by) the mouth are established; 
#tr.en: ... all the people may he rule; 
#tr.en: ... herding all the lands; 
#tr.en: ... the seasonal flood from the deep may come out; 
#tr.en: ... to the dais of the gods may he bring 
#tr.en: ... all over the heavens and earth 
#tr.en: ... aid and protection; 
#tr.en: their ... may they carry him; 
#tr.en: ... 
#tr.en: ... luminary, may he ... 
#tr.en: ... and seas, ... 
#tr.en: ... 
#tr.en: may he establish long days of his reign ... 
#tr.en: living creatures may he ... of his, 
#tr.en: ... days ... life; 
#tr.en: of esagil ... into apsû may stretch (down) its roots(?); 
#tr.en: like the stars in the sky, may he spread the progeny; 
#tr.en: Nazi-murutaš ... and neglected(?); 
#tr.en: living creatures ..., 
#tr.en: ... entire, turned into his city; 
#tr.en: ... may the lord the people, the black-headed, rule;

#tr.en: ... may he command my goodness 
#tr.en: ... the joy of life may he enjoy; 
#tr.en: ... the heavenly care may he have; 
#tr.en: ... may he ease his wailing; 
#tr.en: ... over his subjects; 
#tr.en: ... Šubši-mešrâ-Šakkan 
#tr.en: ... king(?) of the land of Sumer and Akkad, who leads the land; 
#tr.en: once his painful behaviour he has seen, should be absolved his crime; 
#tr.en: ... his grief should be eased; 
#tr.en: may his god praise him, may his goddess honor him; 
#tr.en: ... may people become healthy; 
#tr.en: may his god praise him, may his goddess honor him; 
#tr.en: in happiness of flesh and joy of stomach, may he walk daily; 
#tr.en: ... a praise song ... Šubši-mešrâ-Šakkan 
#tr.en: extolled your glory, ... your praise is good! 
#tr.en: A bronze (jar) for pouring beer 
#tr.en: for Banaya-x-Enlila 
#tr.en: the gudu(-priest) of Ninlil, 
#tr.en: son of Ša-ili-banaya 
#tr.en: When on high the heaven had not been named, 
#tr.en: Firm ground below had not been called by name, 
#tr.en: When primordial Apsu, their begetter, 
#tr.en: And Mummu-Tiamat, she who bore them all, 
#tr.en: Their waters mingled as a single body, 
#tr.en: No reed hut had sprung forth, no marshland had appeared, 
#tr.en: None of the gods had been brought into being, 
#tr.en: And none bore a name, and no destinies determined-- 
#tr.en: Then it was that the gods were formed in the midst of heaven. 
#tr.en: Lahmu and Lahamu were brought forth, by name they were called. (10) 
#tr.en: Before they had grown in age and stature, 
#tr.en: Anshar and Kishar were formed, surpassing the others. 
#tr.en: Long were the days, then there came forth..... 
#tr.en: Anu was their heir, of his fathers the rival; 
#tr.en: Yes, Anshar’s first-born, Anu, was his equal. 
#tr.en: Anu begot in his image Nudimmud. 
#tr.en: This Nudimmud was of his fathers the master; 
#tr.en: Of broad wisdom, understanding, mighty in strength, 
#tr.en: Mightier by far than his grandfather, Anshar. 
#tr.en: He had no rival among the gods, his brothers. (20) 
#tr.en: Thus were established and were... the great gods. 
#tr.en: They disturbed Tiamat as they surged back and forth, 
#tr.en: Yes, they troubled the mood of Tiamat 
#tr.en: By their hilarity in the Abode of Heaven. 
#tr.en: Apsu could not lessen their clamor 
#tr.en: And Tiamat was speechless at their ways. 
#tr.en: Their doings were loathsome unto ... . 
#tr.en: Thier way was evil; they were overbearing. 
#tr.en: Then Apsu, the begetter of the great gods, 
#tr.en: Cried out, addressing Mummu, his minister: (30) 
#tr.en: “O Mummu, my vizier, who rejoices my spirit, 
#tr.en: Come here and let us go to Tiamat!” 
#tr.en: They went and sat down before Tiamat, 
#tr.en: Exchanging counsel about the gods, their first-born. 
#tr.en: Apsu, opening his mouth, 
#tr.en: Said to resplendent Tiamat: 
#tr.en: “Their ways are truly loathsome to me. 
#tr.en: By day I find no relief, nor repose by night. 
#tr.en: I will destroy, I will wreck their ways, 
#tr.en: That quiet may be restored. Let us have rest!” (40) 
#tr.en: As soon as Tiamat heard this, 
#tr.en: She was furious and called out to her husband. 
#tr.en: She cried out aggrieved, as she raged all alone, 
#tr.en: She uttered a curse, and unto Apsu she spoke: 
#tr.en: “What? Should we destroy that which we have built? 
#tr.en: Their ways indeed are most troublesome, but let us attend kindly!” 
#tr.en: Then Mummu answered, giving counsel to Apsu; 
#tr.en: Ill-wishing and ungracious was Mummu’s advice: 
#tr.en: “Do destroy, my father, the mutinous ways. 
#tr.en: Then you will have relief by day and rest by night!” (50) 
#tr.en: When Apsu heard this, his face grew radiant 
#tr.en: Because of the evil he planned against the gods, his sons. 
#tr.en: As for Mummu, he embraced him by the neck 
#tr.en: As that one sat down on his knees to kiss him. 
#tr.en: Now whatever they had plotted between them, 
#tr.en: Was repeated unto the gods, their first-born. 
#tr.en: When the gods heard this, they were astir, 
#tr.en: Then lapsed into silence and remained speechless. 
#tr.en: Surpassing in wisdom, accomplished, resourceful, 
#tr.en: Ea, the all-wise, saw through their scheme. (60) 
#tr.en: A master design against it he devised and set up, 
#tr.en: Made artful his spell against it, surpassing and holy. 
#tr.en: He recited it and made it subsist in the deep, 
#tr.en: As he poured sleep upon him. Sound asleep he lay. 
#tr.en: When he had made Apsu prone, drenched with sleep, 
#tr.en: Mummu, the adviser, was powerless to stir. 
#tr.en: He loosened his band, tore off his tiara, 
#tr.en: Removed his halo and put it on himself. 
#tr.en: Having fettered Apsu, he slew him.

#tr.en: Bansage, the lamentation-priest (and) temple administrator; 
#tr.en: Mulli’a, the mayor; 
#tr.en: (and) the herald are the witnesses. 
#tr.en: To my lord, the bull with sparkling eyes, a beard of lapis-lazuli sporting, 
#tr.en: speak! 
#tr.en: To my golden statue on a favorable day born,
#tr.en: to my water buffalo in a holy fold reared, in the silver-stomach of Inanna chosen,
#tr.en: to my lord, the trusted one of Inanna, repeat! 
#tr.en: You are fashioned like the son of An, 
#tr.en: your utterances, like the words of a god, are irrevocable;
#tr.en: your utterances like rain pouring from the skies, are uncountable; 
#tr.en: this is what Ur-saga, your servant, says: 
#tr.en: My lord has taken care of me; I am a son of Ur. 
#tr.en: If my lord agrees
#tr.en: my father’s household let no one carry off, 
#tr.en: my father’s household let no one take away! 
#tr.en: May my lord know this! 
#tr.en: Messenger, messenger, to my mother 
#tr.en: say 
#tr.en: what monkey says: 
#tr.en: Ur is the city resplendent of Nanna. 
#tr.en:  In Eridu, the city abundant of Enki, 
#tr.en:  indeed I, behind the door of the house of the Chief Musician am sitting. 
#tr.en: Looks are feeding me. 
#tr.en: May I not die! 
#tr.en: There being no fresh bread, there being no fresh beer, 
#tr.en: have a courier send some to me! 
#tr.en: It’s a flood! 
#tr.en: “At his command your weapon struck me evilly. 
#tr.en: As I let the divine powers go out of my hand, these divine powers returned to the abzu. 
#tr.en: As I let the divine plan go out of my hand, this divine plan returned to the abzu. 
#tr.en: This tablet of destinies returned to the abzu. I was stripped of the divine powers.” 
#tr.en: Ninurta was stunned at these words of the Anzu-chick. 
#tr.en: Ninmena gave out a wail: 
#tr.en: “And what about me? These divine powers have not fallen into my hand. 
#tr.en: I shall not exercise their authority. I shall not live (?) like him in the shrine, in the abzu.” 
#tr.en: Father Enki in the abzu knew what had been said. 
#tr.en: The Anzu-chick took the hero Ninurta by his hand 
#tr.en: and drew near with him to Enki’s place, the abzu. 
#tr.en: The Anzu-chick returned Uta-ulu to the abzu. 
#tr.en: The lord was delighted with the hero, 
#tr.en: Father Enki was delighted with the hero Ninurta. 
#tr.en: Lord Nudimmud honored him duly: 
#tr.en: “Hero, no god among your brother gods could have acted so. 
#tr.en: As for the bird which your mighty weapon captured, 
#tr.en: from now to eternity you will keep your foot placed on its neck. 
#tr.en: May the great gods give your heroic strength its due. 
#tr.en: May your father Enlil do whatever you command. 
#tr.en: May Ninmena not fashion your equal (?). 
#tr.en: May no one be as revered as you and no god extend an upraised hand before you. 
#tr.en: Monthly may your house (?) regularly receive tributes in the shrine, in the abzu. 
#tr.en: May An (?) proclaim your name in the seat of honor.” 
#tr.en: The hero secretly was not happy with these promises. 
#tr.en: Where he stood, he darkened and yellowed like (?) a flood-storm (?). 
#tr.en: He contemplated great deeds and inwardly he was rebellious. 
#tr.en: He uttered a word which has no ... 
#tr.en: The hero Ninurta set his sights on the whole world. 
#tr.en: He told no one and inwardly did not ... 
#tr.en: The great lord Enki intuitively grasped the substance of the plan. 
#tr.en: In the shrine, in the abzu he stirred up a dark flood-storm. 
#tr.en: By the house the minister Isimud opposed Ninurta. 
#tr.en: The hero Ninurta refused to come out 
#tr.en: and raised his hand against the minister Isimud. 
#tr.en: (Against Ninurta,) Enki fashioned a turtle from the clay of the abzu. 
#tr.en: Against him he stationed the turtle at an opening, at the gate of the abzu. 
#tr.en: Enki talked to him near the place of the ambush 
#tr.en: and brought him to the place where the turtle was. 
#tr.en: The turtle was able to grab Ninurta's tendon from behind. 
#tr.en: The hero Ninurta managed to turn back its feet. 
#tr.en: Enki, as if perplexed, said, “What is this?!” 
#tr.en: He had the turtle scrape the ground with its claws, had it dig an evil pit. 
#tr.en: The hero Ninurta fell into it with the turtle. 
#tr.en: The hero did not know how to get out from ... 
#tr.en: The turtle kept on gnawing his feet with its claws (?). 
#tr.en: The great lord Enki said to him: 
#tr.en: “From ..., you who set your mind to kill me, 
#tr.en: ... who makes big claims— 
#tr.en: I cut down, I raise up. 
#tr.en: You who set your sights on me like this— 
#tr.en: what has your position seized for you, how ...? 
#tr.en: Where has your strength fled? Where is your heroism? 
#tr.en: In the great mountains you caused destruction, but how will you get out now?” 
#tr.en: Ninmena learned of this situation. 
#tr.en: She was ripping the clothes from her body, she ... . 
#tr.en: “My ug-plant-eater Enki, whom shall I send to you? 
#tr.en: Men will shake their heads in fear ..., whom shall I send to you? 
#tr.en: That name is not Enki. That name is Ugugu-that-does-not-pour (?). 
#tr.en: You who are death without mercy, whom shall I send to you?” 
#tr.en: In those remote days, when the fates were determined; 
#tr.en: in a year when An brought about abundance, 
#tr.en: and people broke through the earth like green plants -- 
#tr.en: then the lord of the abzu, King Enki, 
#tr.en: Enki, the lord who determines the fates, 
#tr.en: built up his temple entirely from silver and lapis lazuli. 
#tr.en: Its silver and lapis lazuli were the shining daylight. 
#tr.en: Into the shrine of the abzu he brought joy. 
#tr.en: An artfully made bright crenellation rising out from the abzu 
#tr.en: was erected for Lord Nudimmud. 
#tr.en: He built the temple from precious metal, decorated it with lapis lazuli, 
#tr.en: and covered it abundantly with gold. 
#tr.en: In Eridu, he built the house on the bank. 
#tr.en: Its brickwork makes utterances and gives advice. 
#tr.en: Its eaves roar like a bull; 
#tr.en: the temple of Enki bellows. 
#tr.en: During the night the temple praises its lord and offers its best for him. 
#tr.en: Before Lord Enki, Isimud the minister praises the temple; 
#tr.en: he goes to the temple and speaks to it. 
#tr.en: He goes to the brick building and addresses it: 
#tr.en: “Temple, built from precious metal and lapis lazuli; 
#tr.en: whose foundation pegs are driven into the abzu; 
#tr.en: which has been cared for by the prince in the abzu! 
#tr.en: Like the Tigris and the Euphrates, it is mighty and awe-inspiring (?). 
#tr.en: Joy has been brought into Enki's abzu. 
#tr.en: Your lock has no rival. 
#tr.en: Your bolt is a fearsome lion. 
#tr.en: Your roof beams are the bull of heaven, an artfully made bright headgear. 
#tr.en: Your reed-mats are like lapis lazuli, decorating the roof-beams. 
#tr.en: Your vault is a wild bull raising its horns. 
#tr.en: Your door is a lion who seizes a man. 
#tr.en: Your stairway is a lion coming down on a man. 
#tr.en: Abzu, pure place which fulfils its purpose! 
#tr.en: E-engura! Your lord has directed his steps towards you. 
#tr.en: Enki, lord of the abzu, 
#tr.en: has embellished your foundation pegs with cornelian. 
#tr.en: He has adorned you with ... and (?) lapis lazuli. 
#tr.en: The temple of Enki is provisioned with silver wax (?); 
#tr.en: it is a bull obedient to its master, 
#tr.en: roaring by itself and giving advice at the same time. 
#tr.en: E-engura, which Enki has surrounded with a silver reed fence! 
#tr.en: In your midst a lofty throne is erected, 
#tr.en: your door-jamb is the silver locking bar of heaven. 
#tr.en: Abzu, pure place, place where the fates are determined 
#tr.en: —the lord of wisdom, Lord Enki, 
#tr.en: Enki, the lord deciding fates— 
#tr.en: Nudimmud, the lord of Eridu, 
#tr.en: lets nobody look into its midst. 
#tr.en: Your abgal priests let their hair down their backs. 
#tr.en: Enki's beloved Eridu, 
#tr.en: E-engura whose inside is full of abundance! 
#tr.en: Abzu, life of the Land, beloved of Enki! 
#tr.en: Temple built on the edge, befitting the artful divine powers! 
#tr.en: Eridu, your shadow extends over the midst of the sea! 
#tr.en: Eridu, your shadow extends over the midst of the sea! Rising sea without a rival; 
#tr.en: mighty awe-inspiring river which terrifies the Land! 
#tr.en: E-engura, high citadel (?) standing firm on the earth! 
#tr.en: Temple at the edge of the engur, a lion in the midst of the abzu; 
#tr.en: lofty temple of Enki, which bestows wisdom on the Land; 
#tr.en: your cry, like that of a mighty rising river, 
#tr.en: reaches (?) King Enki. 
#tr.en: To his silver house its goodness he sets, 
#tr.en: the lyre, the algar instrument, the balag drum 
#tr.en: the ḫarḫar, the sabitum, and the …… miritum instruments offer their best for his silver temple. 
#tr.en: The ... with a sweet sound 
#tr.en: resounded by themselves. 
#tr.en: The silver algar instrument of Enki played for him on his own 
#tr.en: and seven tigi drums resounded. 
#tr.en: What Enki says is irrefutable; 
#tr.en: ... is well established (?).” 
#tr.en: This is what Isimud spoke to the brick building; 
#tr.en: he praised the E-engura with sweet songs 
#tr.en: As it has been built, as it has been built; 
#tr.en: as Enki has raised Eridu up, 
#tr.en: it is an artfully built mountain which floats on the water. 
#tr.en: His shrine (?) spreads (?) out into the reedbeds; 
#tr.en: In its green orchards laden with fruit 
#tr.en: birds brood. 
#tr.en: The suhur carp play among the honey-herbs, 
#tr.en: and the esztub carp dart among the small gizi reeds. 
#tr.en: When Enki rises, the fish rise before him like waves. 
#tr.en: He has the abzu stand as a marvel, 
#tr.en: as he brings joy into the engur. 
#tr.en: Like the sea, he is awe-inspiring; 
#tr.en: like a mighty river, he instils fear. 
#tr.en: The Euphrates rises before him as it does before the fierce south wind. 
#tr.en: His punting pole is Nirah 
#tr.en: his oars are the small reeds. 
#tr.en: When Enki embarks, the year will be full of abundance. 
#tr.en: The ship departs of its own accord, with tow rope held (?) by itself. 
#tr.en: As he leaves the temple of Eridu, 
#tr.en: the river gurgles (?) to its lord: 
#tr.en: its sound is a calf's mooing, the mooing of a good cow. 
#tr.en: Enki had oxen slaughtered, and had sheep offered there lavishly. 
#tr.en: Where there were no ala drums, he installed some in their places; 
#tr.en: where there were no bronze ub drums, he despatched some to their places. 
#tr.en: He directed his steps on his own to Nibru 
#tr.en: and entered the temple terrace, the shrine of Nibru. 
#tr.en: Enki reached for (?) the beer, he reached for (?) the liquor. 
#tr.en: He had liquor poured into big bronze containers, 
#tr.en: and had emmer-wheat beer pressed out (?). 
#tr.en: In kukuru containers which make the beer good he mixed beer-mash. 
#tr.en: By adding date-syrup to its taste (?), he made it strong. 
#tr.en: He ... its bran-mash. 
#tr.en: In the shrine of Nibru, Enki 
#tr.en: provided a meal for Enlil, his father. 
#tr.en: He seated An at the head of the table 
#tr.en: and seated Enlil next to An. 
#tr.en: He seated Nintur in the place of honour 
#tr.en: and seated the Anuna gods at the adjacent places (?). 
#tr.en: All of them were drinking and enjoying beer and liquor. 
#tr.en: They filled the bronze aga vessels to the brim 
#tr.en: and started a competition, drinking from the bronze vessels of Urasz. 
#tr.en: They made the tilimda vessels shine like silver barges. 
#tr.en: After beer and liquor had been libated and enjoyed, 
#tr.en: and after ... from the house, 
#tr.en: Enlil was made happy in Nibru. 
#tr.en: Enlil addressed the Anuna gods: 
#tr.en: “Great gods who are standing here! 
#tr.en: Anuna, who have lined up in the Ubszu-unkena! 
#tr.en: My son, King Enki has built up the temple! 
#tr.en: He has made Eridu rise up (?) from the ground like a mountain! 
#tr.en: He has built it in a pleasant place, 
#tr.en: in Eridu, the pure place, where no one is to enter 
#tr.en: —a temple built with silver and decorated with lapis lazuli, 
#tr.en: a house which tunes the seven tigi drums properly, and provides incantations; 
#tr.en: where silver songs make all of the house a lovely place 
#tr.en: —the shrine of the abzu, the good destiny of Enki, befitting the elaborate divine powers; 
#tr.en: the temple of Eridu, built with silver: for all this, 
#tr.en: Father Enki be praised!” 
#tr.en: To Anūnītum, 
#tr.en: his mistress, did Sargon 
#tr.en: for his life (this) dedicate. 
#tr.en: A’allimu 
#tr.en: son of Namḫani, 
#tr.en: gudu(-officiant) of Nin-ilduma. 
#tr.en: Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, provider 
#tr.en: of Esagila and Ezida, eldest son 
#tr.en: of Nabopolassar, king of Babylon. 
#tr.en: ... 
#tr.en: ... 
#tr.en: ... 
#tr.en: ... the whole/complete festival ... 
#tr.en: When it dawns ... 
#tr.en: ... comes. Him/her ... 
#tr.en: To(?) the male gods he bows ... 
#tr.en: ... my lord, 1 male sheep, land ... 
#tr.en: ... lie in (it). ... 
#tr.en: ... substitutes ... 
#tr.en: ... 
#tr.en:  I survived to the next year; the appointed time passed. 
#tr.en:  1st tablet, ludlul bēl ... 
#tr.en: Keep her apart! Keep her apart! 
#tr.en: The daughters of Anum, (in) the rising of the sky, 
#tr.en: purified the day(?), 
#tr.en: and the heaven of Anum. 
#tr.en: Love was happening, upon the people it was caressing(?). 
#tr.en: May love caress(?) me! 
#tr.en: Let me cast (a spell), let me command, let me speak, let me love. 
#tr.en: Think of me as an ašnugallum-snake 
#tr.en: Let your face rejoice like a wild cow. 
#tr.en: May you not wait for your father's consent. 
#tr.en: May you not take your mother’s advice. 
#tr.en: If she is a q.-woman, may she ... her obligation to work. 
#tr.en: If she is an n.-woman, may she ... a marriage gift. 
#tr.en: If she is a prostitute, may she clean her tavern and upon me fall. 
#tr.en: The incantation is not mine, 
#tr.en: it is an incantation that of Ea and Ištar established. 
#tr.en: To Kurnugi’a, domain of Ereškigal, 
#tr.en: did Ištar, daughter of Sîn, her ear direct; 
#tr.en: indeed did direct the daughter of Sîn her ear 
#tr.en: to the house of darkness, the dwelling of Irkalla, 
#tr.en: to the house where those who enter are not such who exit, 
#tr.en: to the route whose path is one of he who does not return, 
#tr.en: to the house where those who enter are deprived of light, 
#tr.en: Where dust (satisfies) their hunger, their food is clay, 
#tr.en: (where) light they do not see, in darkness they sit 
#tr.en: (where) they are clothed like birds, in garments of feathers, 
#tr.en: over the door and lock, dust was settled, 
#tr.en: Ištar, at the gate of Kurnugi’a arriving, 
#tr.en: to the gatekeeper speaks: 
#tr.en: “Gatekeeper, open your gate for me; 
#tr.en: open your gate for me, that I, indeed I, may enter; 
#tr.en: if you do not open the gate for me, so that I, indeed I, cannot enter, 
#tr.en: I will strike the door, the lock I will break; 
#tr.en: I will strike the posts, I will push the doors aside, 
#tr.en: I will raise up the dead; they will devour the living, 
#tr.en: that the dead will outnumber the living.” 
#tr.en: The gatekeeper worked his mouth, saying, 
#tr.en: speaking to great Ištar: 
#tr.en: “Stand, my lady, do not knock it down, 
#tr.en: let me go and your words repeat to queen Ereškigal.” 
#tr.en: He entered, and the gatekeeper speaks to Ereškigal: 
#tr.en: “Here now, your sister Ištar is standing at your gate, 
#tr.en: she who holds the great hunting loops, who roils up the Apsu before king Ea.” 
#tr.en: Ereškigal, hearing this, 
#tr.en: like cut tamarisk went yellow her face, 
#tr.en: like the edge of a drinking reed went black her lips. 
#tr.en: “What brought her heart to me? What caused her liver to light up for me? 
#tr.en: Here now, shall I, even I, with the Anunnaki water drink? 
#tr.en: As if bread, shall I eat clay? As if beer, shall I drink murky water? 
#tr.en: Let me weep for the young men who leave behind wives? 
#tr.en: Let me weep weep for the maidens who from the lap of their spouses are torn? 
#tr.en: For the weak young one let me weep, who before his days was lead away? 
#tr.en: Go, gatekeeper, open for her your gate, 
#tr.en: treat her according to the ancient rules!” 
#tr.en: Off went the gatekeeper, and opened for her his gate. 
#tr.en: “Enter, my lady, let Kuthâ rejoice over you.” 
#tr.en: May the palace of Kurnugi’a be happy at your presence!” 
#tr.en: The 1st gate he let her enter, and he spread out and took away the great crown of her head. 
#tr.en: “Why, gatekeeper, did you take away the great crown of my head?” 
#tr.en: “Enter, my lady, of the lady of the netherworld thus are her rules.” 
#tr.en: The 2nd gate he let her enter, and he spread out and took away the earrings of her ears. 
#tr.en: “Why, gatekeeper, did you take away the earrings of my ears?” 
#tr.en: “Enter, my lady, of the lady of the netherworld thus are her rules.” 
#tr.en: The 3rd gate he let her enter, and he spread out and took away the beads of her neck. 
#tr.en: “Why, gatekeeper, did you take away the beads of my neck?” 
#tr.en: “Enter, my lady, of the lady of the netherworld thus are her rules.” 
#tr.en: The 4th gate he let her enter, and he spread out and took away the pectoral of her chest. 
#tr.en: “Why, gatekeeper, did you take away the pectoral of my chest?” 
#tr.en: “Enter, my lady, of the lady of the netherworld thus are her rules.” 
#tr.en: The 5th gate he let her enter, and he spread out and took away the belt of birthstones of her hips 
#tr.en: “Why, gatekeeper, did you take away belt of birthstones of my hips?” 
#tr.en: “Enter, my lady, of the lady of the netherworld thus are her rules.” 
#tr.en: The 6th gate he let her enter, and he spread out and took away the bracelets of her hand and her foot. 
#tr.en: “Why, gatekeeper, did you take away the bracelets of my hand and my foot?” 
#tr.en: “Enter, my lady, of the lady of the netherworld thus are her rules.” 
#tr.en: The 7th gate he let her enter, and he spread out and took away the garment of modesty of her body. 
#tr.en: “Why, gatekeeper, did you carry off the garment of modesty of my body? 
#tr.en: “Enter, my lady, of the lady of the netherworld thus are her rules.” 
#tr.en: away from there, Ishtar to Kurnugi’a descended. 
#tr.en: Ereshkigal saw her and in her presence began to shake. 
#tr.en: Ishtar did not reflect; above her she rose. 
#tr.en: Ereshkigal her mouth worked, speaking, 
#tr.en: to Namtar, her high minister, the words speaking: 
#tr.en: “Go, Namtar, ... in my palace, and 
#tr.en: send out against her, the sixty diseases against Ishtar: 
#tr.en: the disease of the eyes against her eyes, 
#tr.en: the disease of the side against her side, 
#tr.en: the disease of the feet against her feet, 
#tr.en: the disease of the stomach against her stomach, 
#tr.en: the disease of the head against her head, 
#tr.en: against her, all of her, against her body!” 
#tr.en: After lady Ištar to Kurnugi’a descended, 
#tr.en: the cow the bull does not mount, the donkey the jenny does not impregnate; 
#tr.en: the young woman in the street does not impregnate the young man; 
#tr.en: lay the young man in his chamber, 
#tr.en: lay the young woman on her side. 
#tr.en: Papsukkal, minister of the great gods: bent low was his nose, his face; 
#tr.en: in rags clad, unkempt hair bearing, ... 
#tr.en: he went, tired, before Sîn, his father, weeping, ... 
#tr.en: before Ea, the king, he was going, his tears ...: 
#tr.en: “Ištar to the underworld descended, but did not ascend; 
#tr.en: since Ištar to Kurnugi’a descended, 
#tr.en: the cow the bull does not mount, the donkey the jenny does not impregnate; 
#tr.en: the young woman in the street is not impregnated by the young man; 
#tr.en: lay the young man in his chamber, 
#tr.en: lay the young woman on her side; 
#tr.en: Ea, in the wisdom of his stomach, has created a man, 
#tr.en: and he created Aṣûšu-namir, a she-man, 
#tr.en: come, Aṣûšu-namir, in the gate of Kurnugi’a set you face! 
#tr.en: may the 7 gates of Kurnugi’a be opened in your face! 
#tr.en: May Ereškigal see you and in your face rejoice! 
#tr.en: when her stomach is calmed, her liver happy, 
#tr.en: make her utter the oath of the great gods! 
#tr.en: Raise your head, to the waterskin ear give! 
#tr.en: “O Lady, the waterskin let them give me, that water therefrom I may drink!” 
#tr.en: Ereškigal, hearing this, 
#tr.en: struck her thigh, bit her finger: 
#tr.en: “You made a request of me that is not to be requested! 
#tr.en: Come, Aṣûšu-namir, let me lay a great curse on you! 
#tr.en: May the breads of the plows of the city be your bread! 
#tr.en: May the drainpipes of the city be your drink, 
#tr.en: the shadows of the wall your stations, 
#tr.en: the threshold your residence! 
#tr.en: May drunks and parched strike your cheek!” 
#tr.en: Ereškigal worked her mouth, saying, 
#tr.en: to Namtar, her minister, words speaking: 
#tr.en: “Go, Namtar, strike Egalgina! 
#tr.en: The thresholds adorn in coral stone! 
#tr.en: The Anunna bring out and on thrones of gold seat them! 
#tr.en: Ištar with water of life sprinkle and take her into(?) my presence!” 
#tr.en: Off went Namtar and knocked at Egalgina; 
#tr.en: the thresholds he decorated with coral stone; 
#tr.en: the Anunna he brought out and on thrones of gold sat them; 
#tr.en: Ištar with water of life he sprinkled and took her into(?) her presence; 
#tr.en: out of the first gate he brought her and returned to her the loincloth of her body; 
#tr.en: out of the second gate he brought her and returned to her her bracelets and anklets; 
#tr.en: out of the third gate he brought her and returned to her the girdle of birth-stones around her waist; 
#tr.en: out of the fourth gate he brought her and returned to her her breast pins; 
#tr.en: out of the fifth gate he brought her and returned to her the beads around her neck; 
#tr.en: out of the sixth gate he brought her and returned to her the earrings on her ears; 
#tr.en: out of the seventh gate he brought her and returned to her the great tiara on her head. 
#tr.en: 1 (gur) wort, fine quality,

#tr.en: How come that I have let food, which is not good, and first quality beer, which is not good tasting, 
#tr.en: enter the houses of the gods of my lord? 
#tr.en: Regarding the riksu preparation (for the offering), which my lord wrote about: 
#tr.en: The riksu preparation (for the offering) is good. It is ready for the inspection of my lord 
#tr.en: and they let the cows of the ḫazannu eat out of my hand (i.e. from my fodder). 
#tr.en: Regarding the poultry, 
#tr.en: which my lord wrote to me about, 
#tr.en: I have let 1 0 ducks, which we inspected in the (process of eating? = i.e. which were fed with) barley, 
#tr.en: be brought to my lord. 
#tr.en: The 5 ducks (and) 4 chickens, 
#tr.en: which my lord had ordered me to let eat flour and groats, 
#tr.en: these 9 birds have been eating (flour and groats) since the 8 th day, 
#tr.en: after I had separated (them from the others). 
#tr.en: 9 ducks (fed with/in exchange?) for the barley and 
#tr.en: and 9 ducks and 11 geese I/they/he have,

#tr.en: Regarding Arad-eššēši, your servant, when I sent (him) 3 of my ducks, 
#tr.en: he had actually sealed 6 ... (birds) 
#tr.en: on his tablet. After I had a tablet sent 
#tr.en: to my lord, I have let them be brought (to Arad-eššēši?). 
#tr.en: Also I have let one aribû garment and two naḫlaptu garments 
#tr.en: be brought to my lord. 
#tr.en: Regarding the atkuppu craftsman (, who makes objects out of reed), the potter, and the boatwright, 
#tr.en: who my lord wrote about, the storehouses 
#tr.en: are full and they have seized it. Furthermore, regarding 
#tr.en: Sîn-mušabši, the šaknu of (the city) Daiḫi (?): 
#tr.en: When he made the logs of musukkannu wood cross 
#tr.en: through the city Dūr-Sîn-muballiṭ, 
#tr.en: and when he took (it) along to the city Arad-Bēlti, 
#tr.en: ...-Sîn the ducks ...

#tr.en: when he seized it, 1 of his (?) ewes (?)... 
#tr.en: he has let them eat, and when the tablet about the barley of my lord 
#tr.en: had arrived, and when I spoke to the ḫazannu 
#tr.en: the following: “Give ṣābu workers and they may carry out the work for wages”, 
#tr.en: he did not give (them). The men have already slaughtered the ducks. 
#tr.en: The son of Sîn-ašarēdu has — (not only) the birds 
#tr.en: intended for his sending(, but also) his gypsum (surface covering) and the flint (blade) 
#tr.en: — chopped them all together into pieces for him.
#tr.en: And for that,which I am talking about,and … since he does not listen to me# ..., 
#tr.en: thus for the going onto the slaughtering block (?) I have placed the birds there. 
#tr.en: ... 
#tr.en: I may go as my lord's substitute! 
#tr.en: The following (say) to my lord: 
#tr.en: Out of (the heart of) the fields of the iššakku farmers, 
#tr.en: (from) the field of Ana-Sîn-taklāku, from there, 
#tr.en: where they were seeded with a seeder-plow (in the middle), 
#tr.en: after Ubāru had let it come up to me, 
#tr.en: Na(ḫ)zi-Marduk had let it come down to me. 
#tr.en: Until there, where the son of Ardīju had established a border, 
#tr.en: (and) after he had received from me, 
#tr.en: he gave to Adad-ē/īriš. 
#tr.en: Your lord said the following: 
#tr.en: “After he let them seed the fifth field for me, 
#tr.en: he has ploughed a fallow field and 
#tr.en: he gave it. 
#tr.en: and the son of Ḫunābu did ... 
#tr.en: The following he said to you: ... 
#tr.en: “He shall not seed ...” 
#tr.en: He made me go up 
#tr.en: and when I had inspected the field of Enlil-kiššat-ilāni, 
#tr.en: (there on) my path the reed was strong. 
#tr.en: When Bunna-Ninurta came down, he(= Enlil-kiššat-ilāni) went up. 
#tr.en: The second and the third (person), 
#tr.en: as many as will inspect him, no one of these will seize him. 
#tr.en: They will get up and they will leave. 
#tr.en: Th e following (say) to my lord: When he is in fetters, 
#tr.en: I am not a fattener, it is the case that I am a 
#tr.en: palace official. I am used to digging canals! 
#tr.en: I said the following: ... 
#tr.en: for the middle of the field of ... 
#tr.en: ... 
#tr.en: and ... of the river ... 
#tr.en: to Bīt-Sîn-māgir 
#tr.en: Their ṣabu workers in the gate of the nāru canal .../of the town Adattu? ...

#tr.en: Esagil-ṣūrīja ... 
#tr.en: ... Adad-šar-ilāni ... 
#tr.en: Speak to Bēl-kala-Marduk [...] 
#tr.en: the following: “Because those of the house of Enlil-kidinnī ... 
#tr.en: are confined in confinements, (because of that) I will come up (?). 
#tr.en: No one gives (them) to me for irrigating! 
#tr.en: Lead them here and do thoroughly inspect each kilâtu dam, which they have made, 
#tr.en: and make your report for the palace return (here)!” 
#tr.en: After he had led them here, the gate of the takkīru canal he inspected. 
#tr.en: (Them, that is) Banâ-ša-Marduk and Arad-Bēlti 
#tr.en: did Bēl-kala-Marduk interrogate, 
#tr.en: (saying) the following: “Why now 
#tr.en: did you cut the reed, and (in) the confinements why 
#tr.en:  are you all confined? 
#tr.en: Why have you all let them remove the entrance way of the king?” 
#tr.en: Aštaba may return here. The resident (?) 
#tr.en: opened the gate. The opening, which they opened, 
#tr.en: —whenever his lord will come here together with me— 
#tr.en: then I will gladly block it (and) 
#tr.en: I may release (you). Now, the town Niggallu 
#tr.en: is not irrigated. Regarding the confinements, 
#tr.en: which you are confined in, 
#tr.en: who will let the king eat the banquet?” 
#tr.en: And now, the reed for the flooding and 
#tr.en: for damming up the canal, 
#tr.en: when I, Arad-Bēlti, Banâ-ša-Marduk, 
#tr.en: Kilamdi-Šīpak of the house of Mubarrû, 
#tr.en: and Martukku, the diviner, 
#tr.en: when we gave it for the takkīru canal, 
#tr.en: there was water in the gate of the takkīru canal of Enlil-kidinni (?). 
#tr.en: For the erecting of a miḫru dam 
#tr.en: of Bīt-Sîn-māgir and

#tr.en: Now, when he carried it off-for how many days to ... 
#tr.en: will he return? May the two workers, who I have detained, dig wells, 
#tr.en: so that they may give water for drawing and so that the house may? live. 
#tr.en: On the first day I let the total of the workers repeatedly cross back and forth over the Dūr-Adad canal (= i.e. to check which parts need redigging/repair?). 
#tr.en: I will have the Dūr-Adad canal dug up until the 1 0 th day and 
#tr.en: I will open the water for the pīḫātu Pān-ṣēri. Regarding the fact that I wen[t to (the ḫarbu fields of ?)] 
#tr.en: the iššakku farmers of the city Āl-Ninurta-muballiṭ ...

#tr.en: ... which my lord wrote to me about the following: “Because in the month simanu, the month du’ūzu, 
#tr.en: .. . and the month abu the digging, which I had ordered you to do, you did not dig 
#tr.en: (because of that) ... The Dūr-Adad canal has dried up.” All I can say is: I have not dug. 
#tr.en: It may dry up, since I have completed the digging in the month simanu already. 
#tr.en: ... Now# it has been left there to dry up. My account was ... 
#tr.en: when my lord inspected it ... in Babylon. Regarding the fact that from the month simanu 
#tr.en: until the month abu reed has .... Now my lord may return and 
#tr.en: ... he may act upon it. After he will have finished (off) the reed, my lord may treat me according to his heart. 
#tr.en: Why are the worktroops idle and I have to wait? 
#tr.en: Regarding the city Emūqāt-Marduk, which my lord wrote to me about the following: 
#tr.en: Because he has not cultivated, they may collect barley from him. In the city Emūqāt-Marduk 
#tr.en: my lord has not dug the nāru canal. I will let it lie fallow. When he wants to cultivate it, 
#tr.en: then it might be the case that the workers,which were (assigned) for me, are already set free for him. The following: "Because with the help of the workers 
#tr.en: you did not dig a canal and you did not cultivate, because of that either the iku irrigation canal or the nāru canal are covered (?)." 
#tr.en: Without my lord(' s permission) I will not dig. Now the workers,which had been (assigned) to me, 
#tr.en: are set free. Therefore my dullu work duty, that of myself, according to (his) heart/mind, he will order (me to do).  I have been staying here (waiting) 
#tr.en: for my lord to return. The following: "When you performed this dullu work duty on your own ( = in that of yourself) 
#tr.en: you did not dig the canal …šu-Marduk." 
#tr.en: When the workers of my lord were idle, then he did not give. But because it was not the offence of the workers (?) 
#tr.en: they will take the barley, which my lord ordered them to take: That of my lord (i.e. from his stocks) 
#tr.en: and his bread, that of my lord. Whenever they are hungry don’t I (usually) receive rations from the house of my lord? 
#tr.en: Regarding the horses,which my lord wrote to me 
#tr.en: the following about: "The horse, which I gave to you, let it be brought to me!" Which horses 
#tr.en: are the ones of my lord and which ones are mine? I have the horses 
#tr.en: of my lord, as well as of my servants and the shepherds of the horses .... 
#tr.en: They have been seized and the horses of so and so, which he spoke about, are ... 
#tr.en: and the horses of my lord are numerous. By my side ... 
#tr.en: ... has mercy with you. Where shall we search for them? The steppe will be filled ... 
#tr.en: Regarding the reed fence, which my lord wrote to me about: Don’t ... 
#tr.en: .... I have already enclosed 80 ninda and the reed bundles, 
#tr.en: which were cut on the estate of Errigu. 
#tr.en: I am worried about bringing them. I will bring them and they will pile them up 
#tr.en: and they will spill them into the iku irrigation canals and the main nāru canal. What shall he (= one) do? 
#tr.en: Kidin-Adad, the son of Ana-kalāma-Adad, the ša rēši šarri ..., 
#tr.en: who is assigned ... in the gardens of Upī, 
#tr.en: has beaten the gardener of my lord and he injured him severly! 
#tr.en: The following: How is your lord doing without me? And 
#tr.en: I have not yet chopped the wood for the king. 
#tr.en: But he, on the other hand, will chop wood. The gardener has told this 
#tr.en: to him, the following: “After it (= the wood) is chopped my lord ... 
#tr.en: ... in his garden ... 
#tr.en: ... “ 
#tr.en: Your servant Ubāru: I m ay go as my lord's substitute! 
#tr.en: The following (say) to my lord: 
#tr.en: Regarding the fields and the ikkaru farmers of my lord: 
#tr.en: Everything is order. On the head side/small side of the fields ... 
#tr.en: of Tukultī-Ekur, which my lord 
#tr.en: wrote to me about,he has established a border ... 
#tr.en: and the workers of the iššakku farmers and the šutāpu workmen have neglected their work 
#tr.en: from the Tukultī-Ekur canal 
#tr.en: up to the ugāru land (intended for farming) in the irrigated territories (belonging to the city) 
#tr.en: of the Ḫamru irrigation districts,which the water in the previous seasonal flooding 
#tr.en: had seized, then became firm there, and 
#tr.en: then stood there. Furthermore the ḫarbu fields 
#tr.en: of Burrutu, which are in 
#tr.en: the irrigated territories (of to the city) of Ḫamru, 
#tr.en: are exempted from levies. He does not need to fulfil the dullu work duty.

#tr.en: Because (?) it was withheld, I will open the namgāru canal Namkar-Simat-Enlil and the namgāru canal Namkar-Enlil. 
#tr.en: (Because) it was 30 (gur) seeds (cropland 300 iku = 243 ha), which they had filled (= seeded ?), when the nāru canal ran dry, 
#tr.en: he had placed water (there). (But) ... in the nāru canal of Etel-pû ... 
#tr.en: ... the nāru canal of Ḫašmar-galdu ... water has not been placed (in there) until now and 
#tr.en: he repeatedly went (away) and he did not open the atappu/palgu-ditch of ...ra. 
#tr.en: .... Regarding that,which my lord has written about: “The following: Open the weirs!” 
#tr.en: Until now they have not placed water in (the upstream side of) the weirs. 
#tr.en: Regarding Irra-gāmil: the tamirtu land of Parak-aḫi is filled (with seeds). 
#tr.en: And (it is) 20 (gur) seeds (cropland 200 iku = 162 ha) at the bank of the river in front of the nāru canal of Parak-aḫi. Then the canal inspector 
#tr.en: has opened the waters and they run. Regarding the natbaktu-reservoir: 
#tr.en: When they had opened the water out of the namgāru canal of Banâ-ša-Marduk, it was too little. 
#tr.en: It will fill the fields of Irra-gāmil, but then I will close the natbaktu-reservoir 
#tr.en: and I will open water from the nāru canal Namkar-Enlil 
#tr.en: for the natbaktu-reservoir. Now, I will open (the natbaktu reservoir) and 
#tr.en: water out of the natbaktu-reservoir of (for) Irra-gāmil may go out. 
#tr.en: Regarding the kalû-dikes of the natbaktu-reservoir: The reed of 5 ḫarbu fields 
#tr.en: of the iššakku farmers of Marduk-nāṣir is thrown (down). I have written to my lord when my lord was residing (in his residence?), 
#tr.en: and now I have written to my lord again. 
#tr.en: After the reed was thrown down and after they had driven the cows of the erreszu and iššakku here, 
#tr.en: (after that) they left. My lord may kindly 
#tr.en: arrive here. And ... regarding Marduk-nāṣir,

#tr.en: if I will now open water into the natbaktu-reservoirs, then

#tr.en: When my lord inspected the tamirtu land of Dūr-Enlilē,
